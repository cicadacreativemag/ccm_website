    I primarily create with traditional print mediums, such as intaglio and lithography. I portray architectural forms, styles and structures, and its relationship to society and history. Recently, my art pieces have portrayed historical events of destruction that have occurred in Colorado. I utilize a combination of linear marks with gestural, painterly marks to depict recognizable architectural structures amidst chaos and disorder. <br><br>

    I dream of a world where we don't blame each other for the world wasting away at our feet and instead take full responsibility for the situation we're in together. The chaos of life inspires me to create and imagine because if our future is not sustainable then we won't have much of a future to look forward to. <br><br>

    I selected two pieces from my time as an undergraduate graphic design student that highlighted Korean cultural identity. They are inverse pieces--one represents nostalgia refrained and one vengeance unfulfilled.<br><br>

This was a mockup of an alternative brand of Yakult (a branded fermented, sweetened milk beverage). The title is a pun&ndash;&ldquo;uyu&rdquo; (우유) means milk in Korean and, of course, cows go moo. <br>

&ldquo;Han&rdquo; (한) is a Korean cultural concept that is often considered a cornerstone of its post-colonial identity. It encapsulates grief, loss, resentment, and bitterness.<br>

    For the past 12 months or so we’ve witnessed much waste at the hands of COVID-19. Potatoes, eggs, milk, beer, and other ripe foods and liquids are being destroyed because of poor distribution strategies and the absence of demand from restaurants, hotels, and the like. The idea of automated destruction of living biology is something I portray in my work through imageries of static industrial machinery and environment. With expressive colors and animated linework composed within relatively stark scenes, I show failure and disorder in this time of crisis.<br><br>

    After many years of undulating motivation, I have finally found the inspiration to create as I once did. I've been taking things slowly, engaging with small writing projects or drawings whenever the feeling is right. I suppose the pandemic has been helpful in that regard and I am excited to achieve some sense of consistency once more. <br><br>

    Poetry, as a method of self-expression, is my ritual of engaging with my emotions cathartically and articulating what I feel into something more than just words. I take great inspiration from Toni Morrison’s magical realism and the perspective of synesthesia, working to bridge the multidimensionalities of human experience that I feel we fail to describe in conversation. <br><br>

    2020 has made me interested in art that discusses collective action problems and empathy. It seems that the heart of these problems isn't just that we disagree on how to best care for people, but that some people don't care for others at all. How do we as a society teach each other how to care for one another? Why is it so hard to teach?<br><br>

    I spend a considerable amount of time contemplating how so many seemingly minute moments make up the fabric of our lives. How we are caught some days, balancing between madness and genius, the past and our present, the future and our past. The mind splits and we find ourselves embracing the destructiveness in order to forge forward amidst the ashes. That journey can take many forms, and the paths that crossed and got us to this point become forgettable. Where do theses memories reside? How do we access them? How much of who we are is made up of things we could never comprehend? <br><br>

    I love to explore the complex relationship between nature and humans in my art. I try to portray how nature is reflected in man just as man is reflected in nature. My ultimate goal is to show that we are one. That we share fear, love, life, and death. <br><br>
