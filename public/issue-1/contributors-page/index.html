	<br> In my work I seek to explore materiality. Through my primary medium of fibers, I work to question the traditionally perceived context of textiles. This is achieved through my incorporation of sculptural elements. Textiles, throughout time, have been used in an ever-changing way. They move with us as they rest on our bodies. My work seeks to understand textiles in a new sense. Some work explores how textiles can be locked into place, become immovable, whereas others allow the textile to transform shape, but in a different way than it would on our bodies.

	<br> I like the idea that ceramics are part of a cycle; things that were once of the earth are invited to return to it again in my process. I believe that makers hold a unique position being artists and craftspeople, and I love their ability to engage in risk and play in their work, and what better way to play than with clay? I am deeply interested in materiality, process, risk and play in my work.

	<br> This story was born one day out of a particularly boring class period and a wandering mind. I had recently seen &#39;Being John Malkovich&#39; and the image of a person being spat out of a tube on the side of the highway bounced around my mind every few days. It showed up in dreams and poems, and then in &#39;Doors in Parallel&#39;.

	<br> Nature is often a mirror through which we view ourselves and seek to make meaning. With these works, I hoped to capture the diversity and fluidity among living things and how identities, bodies, and aesthetics manifest in a variety of ways in our world. By combining elements of surrealism, nature, and mythology, I aim to represent different facets of life within each piece to illustrate the ways in which humans attempt to understand nature.

	<br> Quietness and subtlety are themes in much my work, often paired with a deliberate spatial relationship between forms or between form and viewer. Through the coalescence of form and space with subtle detail, I seek to ignite a thoughtfulness in the viewer about our social, cultural, historical, physical, and mental environments that we collectively and/or individually establish for ourselves.

	<br> Survival is the state of continuing to exist in spite of difficult circumstances. There is beauty in suffering for some it may mean the end but for others it&#39;s a reason to keep living to grow stronger. My work studies the morality of letting a creature suffer when it is wounded and wondering where it&#39;s life may lead if it pushes through the storm.

	<br> My name is Tony Swope, I am a musician, a writer, and a Parkour and Tricking athlete. Most people don&#39;t know that I was the knitting club president in elementary school, aptly named the &#39;knitting king&#39;. I have since branched out from the creative form of yarn, into the more two-dimensional medium known as writing. Some of my favorite authors include Patrick Rothfuss, Aleron Kong, and Karen Miller.

	<br> I&#39;ve wanted to be an artist since I knew what art was. It has always been something I could do and feel like I belonged. I&#39;m constantly inspired by artists showing their art to the world and creating artworks that make people feel and experience things. This is something I am striving for in my own life and art.

	<br> Hi! I&#39;m Nick. I&#39;ve been taking pictures on film for almost four years now, and although it can be frustrating (and expensive!) to wait to develop my pictures, it&#39;s incredibly rewarding. I&#39;m a big nature person, and I love being able to snap a photo and keep hiking, without having to stop and worry about adjusting a bunch of knobs on a digital camera. Plus, when I finally develop a bunch of rolls of film after a few months of saving them up, it&#39;s like a huge gift to myself and I get to see pictures that I had completely forgot about. One of my favorite things about film is the funky effects you can achieve in-camera with no post-processing, such as film burns and double exposures. Outside of taking pictures and hiking, I am an educator at the Environmental Learning Center, I play drums in an amazing local band: Janet Earth, and I&#39;m a huge gardener and spend most of my free days with my tomato plants!

	<br> Trashion began as a Halloween costume after I realized just how wasteful the holiday has become. Now, after creating a number of garments, and putting on the 2019 Trashion Show, my hope is to help train the mind to see trash as more than something at the end of its life.
