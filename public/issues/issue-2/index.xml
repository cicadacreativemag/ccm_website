      <description>Hello again!
We’re happy to announce that, for the second time, Cicada Creative Magazine has published an all-arts, all-welcome, all-heart issue. Finally, something good has come from winter. Issue 02’s contributors have offered their own time, energy, and essence to our cause. Again, we’ve found ourselves humbled and in awe of the creative heart that beats in our community. All of this work has come together in original and curious ways to create a new life force behind the body of this magazine.</description>

      <description>In our house it was the fridge. Was always the fridge. Unless it was little Norman talking, who called it the ‘cold’ until he was old enough to know the difference. He would get confused in the winter. Cold had a singular meaning to him, and it didn’t have to do with the outdoors.
He had an obsession. He loved it. He’d put his toys in it, his juice boxes, his underwear.</description>

      <description>the city speaks to me, candy sweet,
through her white picket fence teeth,
her rotting wooden tongue telling me
stories of my own youth
like i am myself, but a child again,
all big bright eyes
and she is my mother, spinning silvery fables.
the city speaks to me, in echoes,
in hallways of classrooms morphed by memory,
in metallic laughters of a thousand friends
not mine to have. and she speaks like a snake,</description>

      <description>Bury; the memory in the yellow dress of rum of pie of chocolate milk
yellow dress covered in flowers that didn’t bloom
you didn’t care for it anyway
Bury; the girl who held your hair
ready to drag you across the coals
you felt like syrup then
slow
sticky
&amp;amp; too sweet
did she mean to peal you apart?
Bury; the man who called feminism an opinion
fill his coffin with the coffee cups his roommate took</description>

      <description>Midnight
Days sing themselves to sleep with growing silence.
Hauntingly slow comes Diana in hopes of
lingering sounds of live wonder and singing.
Her tears surprise the nocturnal creatures still
sat on benches with loving late night talking.
Looking up for the stars, they keep feet on land.
Or in boughs — upon leaves shaking with night-time.
Strain though she may, the night holds sound close to earth,
and the lights strike too hard to quell any doubt.</description>

      <description>I dreamt of a warm sky frothed like sea foam
A rusted VW van to drive to an hour off ocean
Swan adrift in a deep sky expanding with pinprick light
I dreamt of a perpetual harvest
A banana seat bike sunken down in wet moss
Beads of silver light dripping through hush and crisp windows
I dreamt of a milky white blizzard
A small Ford truck on a cobbled damp drive</description>

      <title>Those Flowers Out Front</title>

      <description>Sometimes I love you like I love those flowers out front.
I don’t dare go beyond the front door to observe them.
Partially due to their delicate nature &amp;amp; I figure
opening the door will blow them down Woodford Avenue.
And you know the neighbors, what they’d say seeing me
chase daffodils in a little pair of shorts.
Partially because there is no better frame of reference
than the view just beyond the door.</description>

      <description>take away my organs
my nerves and nerve-ends
my blood and ribs especially.
take away my heart and
replace it with a vastness that
is substantial.
make room for a nothingness-
the blankness of a sky.

snow to fall inside of me.</description>

      <description>You laid in bed, avoiding sleep;
You fed, like wasted quarters
Into a polychrome slot machine
Four irretrievable hours;
They paled in front of the screen.
And, after the stardust’s hourglass
Was wrung, and dawn was threatened,
Your dollar hinted at a loss
That staggered into thousands;
Shuttered, behind the barricades
Of comforter and slanted shades,
You shuddered at the thought—and swept
Your soul to sleep with sleeping aids.</description>

      <description>Eve in the attic, planning her scheme surrounded by the underclass of rats and reptiles. She lays out her tools on the altar God left from his 6th day rituals: a bone saw, a neat little cleaver, a sweet stinging chloroform rag, a roll of tape and the rough draft of Genesis scribbled on the back of a mangy cat.
Eve moving to the living room, Adam sitting on the couch but any Adam will do.</description>

      <description>A triangle is not a triangle if its lines and points are collected and stacked and stored away in a pantry. Boxes of milk and dried pasta noodles and frozen vegetables aren’t fat and tears and phone lists yet. That man couldn’t hurt me if he was a pile of organs on the street, every part of him somehow present. Does Hurting have a place in the clouds? A body is just a piece too.</description>

      <description>I. HILAND PARK: HOW TO FORGET your feet sank straight through the melted concrete as you were running, worn shoes slipping on air. You didn&amp;rsquo;t say a thing.
II. LEGS WRAPPED UP IN AIR-THIN SHEETS two jeering faces were mounted to the wall, grinning with empty, half-moon eyes. you exorcised yourself on the carpet, twitched and sobbed yourself clean.
a ribbon of yellow outlined the eye sockets, accusingly, tauntingly &amp;ndash; your mother sighed and removed them from the room.</description>

      <description>Joltingly, you wake, and there is penumbra
Intrinsic gray has settled softly behind drawn curtains
A caliginous dusk to wrap securely around you
Chase away the furtive evils that lurk behind closed eyelids
Bad dreams and wraiths crouch low at the edges of dimmed vision
Gossamer is gathered up in corners
An abandoned dominion, a canopy
Deeply breathing in a fragrant chilled air
The window is still open
And this dwelling’s deep-set hum is covered by lilting cricket chirrup</description>

in lacking our own place.</description>

grasping navigating slow slow nocturnal purple coal plumes if you
remove the rails and their flexing wood ties still without lines still comes
daybreak an oval opening comes suns arching back comes horizon lines folded over forms swallowing themselves
a train on an all night tulip petals tucked like knuckles huddled scraping a tendril sky there are no instructions on how to spread pollen there is</description>
