      <description>Identity is a concept that’s always sparked our interest. From our very first meeting, in a coffee shop right on the edge of campus, we knew identity was central to our message. We made a vision board together, listing everything we wanted to curate and amplify. And now, three issues into our magazine, it seems that our identity is finally taking shape.
We first selected identity as our theme for Issue 03 back in January of 2020.</description>

      <description>It’s so simple, her blonde hair says,
Twirled up in a little pouf and secured with gold claws.
One bowl, easy methods, and
It uses ingredients you have in your pantry already!
Flour, butter, and sugar, the lacey printout reads,
But in my pantry are
Rice, cooking oil, and rock candy.
Chocolate chips, she smiles indulgently,
Sesame clusters, I answer silently.
A strand of black falls in my eyes.
I brush it away.</description>

      <description>At birth I was consciously purple. My mother says
an angel pointed
and I turned pearly instead.
At twelve I spoke miracles, I was magic, I heard
What a wonderful world
and was ready to die.
At thirteen I dreamt of &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a wedding
draped in purple and white,
and initiated my yearning years.
At nineteen Apparition underlined my
composition,
no spectacular sun, no angel to warn.
In his eyes I saw…</description>

      <description>reclaiming the garden
where my mother walked
within me grown barren
muscles strain to be free
screams of anger quieted
the storm-rage barred beauty
standing on the edge of
past painted over silent
and future freeing love
replant the uprooted
give voice to past voiceless
give form to the muted
reclaiming my lilith
from inner fury to
singing my sins my truth</description>

      <description>VII. (appendix) Nowadays my brothers and I are spread out, but I know we all look up at the same sky. Even combined, we have only seen a miniscule portion, an infinitesimal fraction; we only know the beauty that has been afforded to us. And I also know the decision would be unanimous: all of us would trade the whole goddamn universe to have our older brother back. There is only one consolation—and it is not different gods whispering the same promises about the preservation of souls after one is gone, because that doesn’t help the ache while we are still alive.</description>

      <description>What he despised most about Phyllis&#39; were the crosses that were screwed into what felt like every wall in the joint. There were the somewhat smaller, twin silver crosses gracing the walls directly next to the oily glass doors, and then there was the longer cross that had each of its four ends outfitted with cheap metalwork meant to evoke leaves and hearts; he figured someone less concerned with the symbol’s sacredness could use it as decoration in some overgrown garden.</description>

      <description>I wanted you to see the black slipper
Silk vest cat eyed
Skin-tight woman.
Wanted you to see the soft
Silhouette I leave
Crumpled sheets
And how late I come home.
What time of day
Did you realize I was a lie?
The blue-washed turtleneck
High waisted sweatpants
Of a soil soul.
Succulent, herb garden girl
Parched of sunlight.
Was it that first Saturday night
At a sticky 11:04 pm when—</description>

      <description>A Visage Overlaid
Like A Dream, Or Illusion
In Mirror’s Constant Glaze
Wide Hues Form His Shapes
Curves Sleek Form Her Shapes
Comfortable He/She Shapes
But His/Her Foreign Patterns
Not Reflected In my own
Uncomfortable Fluid Figure
Enough Alike A Woman
To Slip To Unknown Unequal
In Every Day Assumption
Disjunction Is Disfigurement
In Their Eyes As i Have Not
The Calf They Idolize
Inequality Is Just
In Their Eyes As i Have Not</description>
