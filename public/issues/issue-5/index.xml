      <description>As we settle into a second COVID winter, with Roe v. Wade in jeopardy, the Omicron variant on the rise, and Antarctica melting at record speeds, it seems a new emergency crops up every day. The world feels downright catastrophic, but we are expected to carry on as if nothing is wrong. To put our feelings away, grit our teeth, pretend we don&amp;rsquo;t see what we see, and finish our to-do lists.</description>

      <description>“We must be patient, but I cannot.”-Ophelia, W. Shakespeare
Wafting down the brook of life, dying, she wants to see him more, last, once again. Time. Ripples through her in, oh, so many eddies. Is he somewhere here among these folds of living water that are trapping her in, limb by Iimb? This is what Ophelia, daughter, sister, virgin, woman, wants: to find, discover, invent bits of him inside of her.</description>

      <description>is October, 2019. I watch the ochre trees fly past, watch
his hands grip the top of the wheel, 64-year-old bones on I-75.
we know he has crickets in his brain. we don’t yet know
just how many. his chauffeur’s uniform of Levi’s &amp;amp; sweatshirt —
the color of blueberries — is the same as ever.
my mother reaches for him. JohnnyJohnnybecarefulplease.

      <description>but i never asked for this
they taught me to light up the room
a woman is a beautiful thing, after all
i was a [wife] before i had a chance to be anything else
the knowledge of good and evil was too tempting for me
i know what you’re thinking, that’s so like you
to bite first, a mouthful of blood: blaspheme
is found in the skin peeling off my lip</description>

      <description>I only wanted to love and not be blamed:
Get her off of the floor
Quickly
Before the grout between the tiles
Runs red
Before she stiffens
Into marble
Take her to me
There is still time
Before the red runs dry
And she starts to bleed gold
She is still soft
I will steal her
Before you can add more stone to your quarry
Bring her home
To the hearth</description>

turtles are roaming the lonely shore — they tell a prophecy
of pollution. overhead, keys turn in the locks of the afterglow and
decay pours out. will we always be grieving the fireflies?
my diagnosis is embodiment of starving personhood. the land

      <description>i grasp broken mirrors, turn away; try to catch light. by grace, God gives me the sun. in return, I give him my mind. hands cold,
covered in clay: dirty, then whisked away. when this vessel speaks,
i am, weak. held by its tongue, like fake love, immersed in its soliloquies:
synecdoches sung saccharine, like symphonies.
Feet that wander towards Sodom are
connected to bodies that bury their hands in the mud and listen to their mouths beg for more, Or for lies between my lips that</description>

      <description>I am submerged in the Then,
the all-consuming memory
of my father’s hands, gray
and bony, struggling to grasp
the orange cap of a soda bottle–
trying to twist and missing,
trying and missing, then twisting
on three – he is no old man
but now his fingers are confused
and wandering across the ferry seat
to me, where my hand is already open
to take on the role of bottle opener</description>

      <description>You dip your hands slightly into your ribcage, troubled by the waves of your breath. Your ribs give, bending so easily under your palm like they were made of mud. You dig, locking your hand around your quickly melting rib. It begs to bleed into your flesh. You take it from its place, its milky pools running down your hands, and drop it. The white thing oozes into the clay ground.</description>

      <description>Clutches his train ticket in shaking hands. White fingernails cutting his palms. Bleeding onto the ticket. His ticket to nowhere Rudy descends into the train station. God’s voice thunders over head, declaring the terms of His covenant. ‘Mind the gap.’ Rudy cannot make out what He is saying. Deafened by the grinding of machines. Stifled by the heat. Jostled between strangers. Stale air passed between brown lungs.
Waves crash against Rudy’s throat.</description>

i tried to grab it but it slipped
between my butterfingers
(which the punching bag game
at the gas station told me I had)
I wanted to run
from the mud
layering layers over my brain (stuck between skull and tissue)
and disembody the worms that grew in the sickly, zero ph garden
that laches itself onto the top of my neck:
the plowed garden that pulls the strings that instructs my shoulders to tense,</description>
