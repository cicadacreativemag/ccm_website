 I&#39;m an art teacher in the NYC public school system, and have run an afterschool book design class with 2nd to 5th graders for 6 years now. I primarily work in ink and watercolor, but have created a lot of art in acrylics and oils too (I don&#39;t paint in oils any more). I was an illustrator for 25 years but moved fully on into teaching and selling my personal paintings. I miss the illustration assignments and am excited to get back into freelance illustration with my new kid friendly style. I live on the upper east side of Manhattan, and am married with one child.

 I used handy dandy Crayola watercolors, which were a staple tool of my early art creating years in the 00s. In 2024 though, I use a water brush which leads to a lot more precision than the brush that comes with the paints. I then used a photo editing software to layer together the pieces I had painted on separate pages to make it one piece, without fiddling around with cutting each element out.

 I aim to use illustration as a storytelling medium to reckon with technology, nostalgia, identity, and the human versus the machine. I&#39;ve been drawing since I was old enough to gather inspiration from the cartoons I&#39;d watch on my family&#39;s CRT television, and continue with the hope of one day inspiring new artists in the same way.

 Whenever I am asked to describe my work, I respond with the quote by historian and novelist Umberto Eco: &#39;every story tells a story that has already been told.&#39; In my collages and photography, by reusing recurring topics and elements, I highlight the inevitability of events and their consequences; the repeating cycles and patterns in the history of humanity; the meshed hope and hopelessness; and how often what we think we have an agency to choose has been chosen for us beforehand. Knowing that viewers will approach and read my works through their own biases and experiences, I encourage them to decide who is the hero and who is the villain, or if the outcome is a blessing or a curse. I am fascinated with the concepts of nature versus nurture, what makes us us, and how many different people we are depending on the context.
