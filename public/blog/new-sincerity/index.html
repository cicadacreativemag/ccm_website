<p>Art  changes throughout time, evolving to address each century’s unique  struggles and values. In an effort to retaliate against the cynicism of a  post-war era, modern writers began to pioneer a new age of writing  which they called New Sincerity. This era was founded upon the idea that  in modern times it was far more courageous to describe the subtle dust  and honesty of everyday life than it was to write about extreme emotion.  It rebelled against the idea that sentimentality was naive and instead  sought to express it. This idea appealed to me as I came to college.  Repulsed by the aftertaste of teenage angst on my tongue, I became  enchanted with the lingering notion that honesty could be a form of  rebellion. As the world began to shut down during quarantine, I wondered  if this idea would hold up in a time of isolation. I wondered if  sincerity would still be resilient.</p>
<p>When  March reared its ugly head my fast-paced freshman year of college  became completely still, like that of many others. This stillness  bothered me. I felt utterly useless as I read each morning about the  thousands of people across the globe who were falling victim to a virus  which was completely indifferent to them. There was no real outlet to  express my frustration. It is hard to rebel against something which is  so indifferent. The only way I know how to rebel against indifference is  to be sincere. In a nation more ravaged with the virus than ever  before, the age of New Sincerity is more relevant now than it was before  quarantine.</p>
<p>Zadie Smith demonstrates the ways in which art is an  instrument of sincerity in her short story, “Words and Music”. This  short story follows unique characters in distinct settings, every  character connected solely by their passion for art. Through these  characters she encapsulates the enduring beauty of artistic expression.</p>
<p>The  story opens on a young girl scatting, using her voice to imitate the  tones of an instrument. The girl’s strange devotion to sounds and shapes  even if they lack linguistic meaning emphasizes the bizarre appeal of  art. Zadie Smith uses the meaninglessness of the sounds in this passage  in order to convey a lack of intention. This art is not trying to be  grandiose or profound. Rather, its purpose is simply to exist. Through  this Smith suggests that the beauty of music is created when it is born  for its own sake; without bragging of its melody or begging for an  audience. Similarly, the artist is most sincere when their art is  created from an inexplicable desire of expression, and it is this  relentless desire which Smith finds admirable.</p>
<p>We see these  sentiments repeated as the narrative changes to follow a man without  legs who talks endlessly of disco. His enduring loyalty to music he can  no longer dance to is a testament to the stubborn admiration humans have  for music. This relentless love begs the question, what is it about  music that captures us? Why do we love it unconditionally? Zadie Smith  does not attempt to answer these questions and instead suggest that the  simple fact that humans love art so ardently is magnificent within  itself.</p>
<p>Zadie Smith blurs the lines between identity and art in  her final scene. She describes an outdoor concert in which multitudes of  people gather to listen to a lone guitarist. The concert becomes a  near-supernatural affair as she describes the music surrounding the  people and the ways in which it hijacks their thoughts. Here, the main  character entertains the idea of a purely auditory world. How would she  distinguish herself from other sounds? Would they merely mesh together  to form a convoluted kind of symphony? By stripping away the material  world and leaving only sound behind, Zadie Smith confronts the ways in  which one&rsquo;s voice is tangled in the music of the world. Identity then  becomes blurred with art, and only regains its independence through  consciousness. Once again, art enables honesty of identity, and it is  through this honesty that these characters find a sliver of catharsis.</p>
<p>What  Zadie Smith ultimately digs at in “Words and Music” is the idea that  art is the product of an intangible itch on the soul. You scratch  endlessly, you bleed onto paper, but your soul will always itch.  Although never perfect, within art there exists a shadow of honesty, and  this is why I cling to it so fervently. It is why during this pandemic  my headphones felt as natural as hair and I had to clear my bed of books  each night. I think that art, no matter how sloppy or unedited it is,  is rebellion. I think each time you sing, dance, or draw simply because  you want to, you are voicing a silent “fuck you” to indifference. It is  through sincerity of expression that we can retaliate against everything  threatening vulnerability. I use art to cope because underneath  metaphors and melodies art gives me a chance to be sincere.</p>
<p>As we  head into winter and what will likely be a few more challenging months, I  want to leave you with my favorite quote by Zadie Smith:</p>
<p>“He who  sings to himself without earbuds is especially precious to me now, like  hearing the song of a bird long thought extinct.”</p>
<p>I hope it reminds you that art is never foolish and encourages you to create with abandon.</p>
