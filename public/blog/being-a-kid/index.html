<p>Sometimes
college is the place where we lose it—it not referring to virginity, 
house keys, parental respect, or mental stability. Hard as it is to 
admit, I myself have lost it more than once here, despite the fact that 
I’ve spent a lot of money to become an undergrad and curate it, in hopes
of making it marketable. This month we were asked to talk about 
creative coping, and I’m here to announce that I have been doing no such
thing—not in the pandemic, not in the summer, not even at any point in 
my college career. I have had tunnel vision since maybe Antiquity.</p>
<p>There
is an indefinable creative quality that lives its life very gently, 
very quietly in that back of our heads. It is slippery and shy as an 
eggshell in cake batter. It’s kind of an asshole: it doesn’t care that 
you haven’t written in three months or that a residency application 
deadline is tonight. To get it to clock in, everything must be just 
right, it has to feel safe; the stars must align, the to-do list must be
full (but not too full), the head must be clear. I do not encounter 
these conditions very often. So it is often absent for me now.</p>
<p>This
is the point where being able to define it might be important. I am not
talking about happiness, or creativity, or passion, or motivation, or 
even the want to make something. In my mind, it is something that 
cohabitated with my brain, happily, until I graduated high school. For 
me, it was an organic, almost frenzied connection to writing. I would 
come home from school every day (every! day! it baffles me now) and sit 
at my dad’s old white computer to write for hours, with no desire to 
pause or snack or do anything other than write. This is the period in my
life that defined me as a writer; even when I stopped being able to do 
that, I still considered myself one. In retrospect, it was probably 
still lurking in the back of my head, refusing to surface, waiting for 
me to forget about it so it could come back, unnoticed, to rekindle 
something.</p>
<p>This is super specific. I do not expect anyone to 
be able to relate to it. But for the sake of making someone feel seen, I
have compiled a checklist to help us recognize it, since I believe it 
bops around and manifests itself in different ways; ways which might 
reassure you that it has not left you, even if you’re having a hard time
creating right now; or might remind you of the park you went to as a 
child; or that might make your eyes glaze over until you hit the end of 
the list or, god forbid, click back to your Instagram feed.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will sit down and pick a movie. It will not take you eighty years to do it.*   When there were still theaters, you would walk out, sneakers muffled on the carpet, shocked that it was still daytime.</li>
<li>Reading <a href="https://cicadacreativemag.com/issuepage.html">Artist Animal</a> makes you want to swim to the bottom of the ocean, immediately.</li>
<li>Last year, when a friend got up from the café table to refill their coffee,you doodled something on the back of the dirty napkin. It was a poem or a
honeybee or an exceptionally straight line. You felt the need to put it
in your pocket, and now it lives in some drawer somewhere, and if youwent to find it right now you would feel alarmed at how brutally honestit is.</li>
<li>Your Pinterest boards are clustered. You cling to Mori Kei skirts or Swedish interior decorating until you don’t.</li>
<li>You could not separate the fire from the heat, even if you tried.</li>
<li>While you’re falling asleep, while your mind is doing whatever minds do inthe forty minutes it takes you to start dreaming, you could be joltedback awake by remembering you haven’t wished your uncle a happy Friday,even though it is Tuesday and you haven’t spoken to him since he taggedyou in a post about nephews he found on the Cows are Angels in DisguiseFacebook page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, what I’m rambling on about is a 
sense of presence that precedes an ability to create. Personally, I do 
not think higher education (or pandemics, or unruly elections, or 
natural disasters) is all that conducive to the kind of presence that 
offers a place for the spontaneous content that is easiest to make. 
Understand that I am not saying it is impossible to make something 
non-academic without it; I am merely trying to articulate something 
that’s been bothering me since my daily word count became my monthly 
word count.</p>
<p>In our present moment, which is terrible, we need 
every support we can get to create something external. My fiction 
workshop professor would implore you to write (or draw, or needle-felt, 
whatever) what needs to be written (drawn, felted, whatever), especially
now; to offer that space to someone else who might need it, or even to 
offer it to yourself.</p>
<p>But trying to create right now is really 
hard. It is really hard to sit down and stare at a blank page and 
remember how easy it used to be. It’s hard to come to terms with the 
fact that all your creating goes into files for school which you might 
not ever look at again, that you’ve run out of energy, that everyone is 
telling you how important it is to keep making in a time when the most 
organic parts of us are hibernating. It’s hard to pivot an entire 
identity on creation and exist in a time where it’s impossible to 
process what’s going on, and more impossible still to face the guilt of 
distracting yourself.</p>
<p>I’m only here to tell you that coping looks
very different depending on the day, the hour. Sometimes it’s great to 
force out something creative and be proud that you can, even with the 
absence of it; sometimes all we can do is browse the Documentary section
on Netflix unfeelingly and be a little inspired but mostly jealous that
someone created such a pretty film in a time like this. I’m also here 
to remind you to look for it; to not be upset that it might be hiding 
again; to console it, and console yourself. It is not gone; it couldn’t 
possibly be, it loves you too much; and if you can’t create right now, 
okay, then maybe you have the time to roll out a welcome mat and dust 
the curtains should it decide to tiptoe back some morning soon.</p>
