      <description>Hello again!
We’re happy to announce that, for the second time, Cicada Creative Magazine has published an all-arts, all-welcome, all-heart issue. Finally, something good has come from winter. Issue 02’s contributors have offered their own time, energy, and essence to our cause. Again, we’ve found ourselves humbled and in awe of the creative heart that beats in our community. All of this work has come together in original and curious ways to create a new life force behind the body of this magazine.</description>

      <description>Identity is a concept that’s always sparked our interest. From our very first meeting, in a coffee shop right on the edge of campus, we knew identity was central to our message. We made a vision board together, listing everything we wanted to curate and amplify. And now, three issues into our magazine, it seems that our identity is finally taking shape.
We first selected identity as our theme for Issue 03 back in January of 2020.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a harrowing 2021. A disorienting sequel to 2020&amp;rsquo;s litany of challenges, it seems we cannot agree on anything. Instead, it often feels as though we are all running on different tracks expecting to arrive at a place of stability, some form of homeostasis.
Entropy is a measurement of chaos. The second law of thermodynamics posits that energy expended in a closed system cannot be recovered. Further, this axiomatic law asserts that entropy will always increase.</description>

      <description>As we settle into a second COVID winter, with Roe v. Wade in jeopardy, the Omicron variant on the rise, and Antarctica melting at record speeds, it seems a new emergency crops up every day. The world feels downright catastrophic, but we are expected to carry on as if nothing is wrong. To put our feelings away, grit our teeth, pretend we don&amp;rsquo;t see what we see, and finish our to-do lists.</description>

      <description>My sister is solving crossword puzzles in the kitchen,
A yellow highlighter in hand and a green one beside her.
I make one for her with grid paper and English.
It begins with words and I fill in the rest with scraps,
Letters poured around words like sand poured into a box of golf balls.
Consider the Infinite Library:
“A building containing every possible combination of letters and lexical symbols.”</description>

      <description>What may be more glorious than the sky’s expanse?
of fibrous clouds / puffy disentombed bodies &amp;ndash;
Roll on! Roll on! Row on.
God walks dully along. / Drowning man
un-abandoned / until
one knight comes, a thief arrives
at this raucous garden with a sword.
Stands before
sealed mysteries/
redundant prophecies/ it is an oblong bible,
yet, God speaks orotund to the blind.
God Speaks
Line 1: Cf. “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry” by Walt Whitman Line 4: “God walks dully along”; Cf.</description>

      <description>It’s so simple, her blonde hair says,
Twirled up in a little pouf and secured with gold claws.
One bowl, easy methods, and
It uses ingredients you have in your pantry already!
Flour, butter, and sugar, the lacey printout reads,
But in my pantry are
Rice, cooking oil, and rock candy.
Chocolate chips, she smiles indulgently,
Sesame clusters, I answer silently.
A strand of black falls in my eyes.
I brush it away.</description>

      <description>“We must be patient, but I cannot.”-Ophelia, W. Shakespeare
Wafting down the brook of life, dying, she wants to see him more, last, once again. Time. Ripples through her in, oh, so many eddies. Is he somewhere here among these folds of living water that are trapping her in, limb by Iimb? This is what Ophelia, daughter, sister, virgin, woman, wants: to find, discover, invent bits of him inside of her.</description>

      <description>In our house it was the fridge. Was always the fridge. Unless it was little Norman talking, who called it the ‘cold’ until he was old enough to know the difference. He would get confused in the winter. Cold had a singular meaning to him, and it didn’t have to do with the outdoors.
He had an obsession. He loved it. He’d put his toys in it, his juice boxes, his underwear.</description>

his hands grip the top of the wheel, 64-year-old bones on I-75.
we know he has crickets in his brain. we don’t yet know
just how many. his chauffeur’s uniform of Levi’s &amp;amp; sweatshirt —
the color of blueberries — is the same as ever.

      <description>You’ll howl forever while I roll my eyes
Powered by a wind up switch
Sticking out of the back of my neck
Like a rogue bone
Twisted and supposed to rattle my voice box
But the ill painted ballerina pierced through my tongue does not sing
Supisd mechanical broken thing
Just rolls its eyes round and round
Like a marble loose in its head
And you
I think you vacuumed your eyes for me</description>

      <description>At birth I was consciously purple. My mother says
an angel pointed
and I turned pearly instead.
At twelve I spoke miracles, I was magic, I heard
What a wonderful world
and was ready to die.
At thirteen I dreamt of &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a wedding
draped in purple and white,
and initiated my yearning years.
At nineteen Apparition underlined my
composition,
no spectacular sun, no angel to warn.
In his eyes I saw…</description>

where my mother walked
within me grown barren
muscles strain to be free
screams of anger quieted
the storm-rage barred beauty
standing on the edge of
past painted over silent
and future freeing love
replant the uprooted
give voice to past voiceless
give form to the muted
reclaiming my lilith
from inner fury to
singing my sins my truth</description>

      <description>Too much tongue
Drips down my throat
Banana slug
On a childrens slide
On the stickiest summer sunday
Playing a drunk jock,
Death slobbers all over me
The slime of slurred speech
He&amp;rsquo;s speaking about stifled screams
They’re now rolling on down through me
(not nearly as fast as i’m rolling my eyes)
I imagine them washing down the banana slug
Grimy children at the top of the slide
Bucket of water fountain water in hand</description>

they taught me to light up the room
a woman is a beautiful thing, after all

      <description>the city speaks to me, candy sweet,
through her white picket fence teeth,
her rotting wooden tongue telling me
stories of my own youth
like i am myself, but a child again,
all big bright eyes
and she is my mother, spinning silvery fables.
the city speaks to me, in echoes,
in hallways of classrooms morphed by memory,
in metallic laughters of a thousand friends
not mine to have. and she speaks like a snake,</description>

      <description>VII. (appendix) Nowadays my brothers and I are spread out, but I know we all look up at the same sky. Even combined, we have only seen a miniscule portion, an infinitesimal fraction; we only know the beauty that has been afforded to us. And I also know the decision would be unanimous: all of us would trade the whole goddamn universe to have our older brother back. There is only one consolation—and it is not different gods whispering the same promises about the preservation of souls after one is gone, because that doesn’t help the ache while we are still alive.</description>

      <description>I only wanted to love and not be blamed:
Get her off of the floor
Quickly
Before the grout between the tiles
Runs red
Before she stiffens
Into marble
Take her to me
There is still time
Before the red runs dry
And she starts to bleed gold
She is still soft
I will steal her
Before you can add more stone to your quarry
Bring her home
To the hearth</description>

The loop glowed and gleamed speciously just as the fake gold once had and still did,
but now from the comfort and safety of a trash can.
Eyes dulled umber and staring directly into gravestone grey, you stood up from the bed in pursuit of something more comfortable than the constant</description>

      <description>“No, no, this is on me”, she says, pulling her purse from her bag, refusing to let me even think about putting money towards our lattes, a shared need for coffee having bought us together in a city which we both do not know how to speak of what we feel towards it, and I do not know how to speak of how I appreciate our shared time together.</description>

At the door of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s palm, Tao Qian

And the name stood the rigours of inescapable

      <description>What he despised most about Phyllis&#39; were the crosses that were screwed into what felt like every wall in the joint. There were the somewhat smaller, twin silver crosses gracing the walls directly next to the oily glass doors, and then there was the longer cross that had each of its four ends outfitted with cheap metalwork meant to evoke leaves and hearts; he figured someone less concerned with the symbol’s sacredness could use it as decoration in some overgrown garden.</description>

      <description>Midnight
Days sing themselves to sleep with growing silence.
Hauntingly slow comes Diana in hopes of
lingering sounds of live wonder and singing.
Her tears surprise the nocturnal creatures still
sat on benches with loving late night talking.
Looking up for the stars, they keep feet on land.
Or in boughs — upon leaves shaking with night-time.
Strain though she may, the night holds sound close to earth,
and the lights strike too hard to quell any doubt.</description>

Let me preach to you a second
Priestly, for you must believe
Without understanding why.
In bounded phase space,
Where fluids turn flat and ideal
Temperatures are negative.
I mean truly negative,
Kelvin negative, less than
Absolute zero negative.
In most systems adding energy
Means an increase in entropy
Not for us though. Not for us.

Silk vest cat eyed
Skin-tight woman.
Wanted you to see the soft
Silhouette I leave
Crumpled sheets
And how late I come home.
What time of day
Did you realize I was a lie?
The blue-washed turtleneck
High waisted sweatpants
Of a soil soul.
Succulent, herb garden girl
Parched of sunlight.

now resting in hard soil.
we stand over them, sandalled,
on spent words and Word:
Now, Christ, my God, hangs on a cross
in an implacable horizon
His lips are baked and black.
I trace the labyrinth
on my common palm,
“the sign is… burning…”
before exhaling,
to move away from what was, and is,
still, a recognizable face.

      <description>I dreamt of a warm sky frothed like sea foam
A rusted VW van to drive to an hour off ocean
Swan adrift in a deep sky expanding with pinprick light
I dreamt of a perpetual harvest
A banana seat bike sunken down in wet moss
Beads of silver light dripping through hush and crisp windows
I dreamt of a milky white blizzard
A small Ford truck on a cobbled damp drive</description>

      <description>You dip your hands slightly into your ribcage, troubled by the waves of your breath. Your ribs give, bending so easily under your palm like they were made of mud. You dig, locking your hand around your quickly melting rib. It begs to bleed into your flesh. You take it from its place, its milky pools running down your hands, and drop it. The white thing oozes into the clay ground.</description>

Like A Dream, Or Illusion
In Mirror’s Constant Glaze
Wide Hues Form His Shapes
Curves Sleek Form Her Shapes
Comfortable He/She Shapes
But His/Her Foreign Patterns
Not Reflected In my own
Uncomfortable Fluid Figure
Enough Alike A Woman
To Slip To Unknown Unequal
In Every Day Assumption
Disjunction Is Disfigurement
In Their Eyes As i Have Not
The Calf They Idolize
Inequality Is Just
In Their Eyes As i Have Not</description>

      <description>I will search for you through a thousand worlds
and lifetimes until I find you.
The way forth faced within.
In the rush of rolling currents;
In the quiet ease, the numb of
nebulae and golden crystals paved.
As gated veils lulled and lulled;
lensing in gravitational gamuts —
&amp;amp; there thrust Shinjin&amp;rsquo;s forces, lime
luminous red; some shade of light&amp;rsquo;s
sight sees the look of Arrokoth
gliding toward the distant blue</description>

      <description>Clutches his train ticket in shaking hands. White fingernails cutting his palms. Bleeding onto the ticket. His ticket to nowhere Rudy descends into the train station. God’s voice thunders over head, declaring the terms of His covenant. ‘Mind the gap.’ Rudy cannot make out what He is saying. Deafened by the grinding of machines. Stifled by the heat. Jostled between strangers. Stale air passed between brown lungs.
Waves crash against Rudy’s throat.</description>

at the gas station told me I had)
I wanted to run
from the mud
layering layers over my brain (stuck between skull and tissue)
and disembody the worms that grew in the sickly, zero ph garden
that laches itself onto the top of my neck:
the plowed garden that pulls the strings that instructs my shoulders to tense,</description>

      <description>Orphaned.
No one sheds a tear for an orphaned child. Not when it&amp;rsquo;s me.
But you wonder who my parents are
And it picks at their brains
An insatiable itch
An insatiable itch
A invoiceable fear that I am yours
The accident child
Borne from a single moment
A rogue campfire spark
A quick mistake
Or maybe I’m not yours
But borne from lightning
And a quick moment when electricity meets the earth</description>

      <description>Sometimes I love you like I love those flowers out front.
I don’t dare go beyond the front door to observe them.
Partially due to their delicate nature &amp;amp; I figure
opening the door will blow them down Woodford Avenue.
And you know the neighbors, what they’d say seeing me
chase daffodils in a little pair of shorts.
Partially because there is no better frame of reference
than the view just beyond the door.</description>

      <description>You laid in bed, avoiding sleep;
You fed, like wasted quarters
Into a polychrome slot machine
Four irretrievable hours;
They paled in front of the screen.
And, after the stardust’s hourglass
Was wrung, and dawn was threatened,
Your dollar hinted at a loss
That staggered into thousands;
Shuttered, behind the barricades
Of comforter and slanted shades,
You shuddered at the thought—and swept
Your soul to sleep with sleeping aids.</description>

      <description>Eve in the attic, planning her scheme surrounded by the underclass of rats and reptiles. She lays out her tools on the altar God left from his 6th day rituals: a bone saw, a neat little cleaver, a sweet stinging chloroform rag, a roll of tape and the rough draft of Genesis scribbled on the back of a mangy cat.
Eve moving to the living room, Adam sitting on the couch but any Adam will do.</description>

      <description>A triangle is not a triangle if its lines and points are collected and stacked and stored away in a pantry. Boxes of milk and dried pasta noodles and frozen vegetables aren’t fat and tears and phone lists yet. That man couldn’t hurt me if he was a pile of organs on the street, every part of him somehow present. Does Hurting have a place in the clouds? A body is just a piece too.</description>

II. LEGS WRAPPED UP IN AIR-THIN SHEETS two jeering faces were mounted to the wall, grinning with empty, half-moon eyes. you exorcised yourself on the carpet, twitched and sobbed yourself clean.
a ribbon of yellow outlined the eye sockets, accusingly, tauntingly &amp;ndash; your mother sighed and removed them from the room.</description>

      <description>Joltingly, you wake, and there is penumbra
Intrinsic gray has settled softly behind drawn curtains
A caliginous dusk to wrap securely around you
Chase away the furtive evils that lurk behind closed eyelids
Bad dreams and wraiths crouch low at the edges of dimmed vision
Gossamer is gathered up in corners
An abandoned dominion, a canopy
Deeply breathing in a fragrant chilled air
The window is still open
And this dwelling’s deep-set hum is covered by lilting cricket chirrup</description>

      <description>Organic Into the days of wanting night —
we stick our heads
in pillowcases. The hardwood floors have lost their varnish
and have paint dots spattered
on their faces.
So we step lightly —
knowing violence
in lacking our own place.</description>

      <description>SUBMIT Submissions are currently closed! They will open in January 2023, so check back soon. Here at CCM, we’ve branded ourselves as more than a literary magazine. We aim to reach beyond traditional definitions of art and writing. So, we&amp;rsquo;ve reimagined artistic categories as the following:
Auditory Music recordings Spoken poetry/writing Film (may also fall under Visual) Spatial Topography and GIS Architectural layouts Interior design Language Poetry, flash fiction, etc. Reporting or feature writing Written sheet music Visual Computer generated images Culinary art Games and programming Textiles, clothing, and fashion design Cosmetology Cultural/Social Essays and research Field notes and creative data You can combine elements of these categories &amp;ndash; several of the examples we provided can fall into multiple categories, and we encourage you not to let these categories limit you.</description>

      <description>ABOUT Cicada Creative Magazine is an interdisciplinary, all-arts publication. Cicada was founded in 2018, the brainchild of seven undergraduate students at Colorado State University. We wanted to assemble something new: a creative magazine accessible to all CSU undergraduate students across all disciplines. At the time, our on-campus publications were open only to a sliver of students based on GPA or major, and most literary magazines focus exclusively on writing and/or visual art.</description>

It makes you think of Buzzfeed and CO-Sign and while all that&amp;rsquo;s well and good, they don’t have any sizable impact on your livelihood (or at least I hope not). Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s because when we go out late at night, with a baggie hoodie draped around our shoulders and the wind is rustling through our hair and we look up at the sky, most of what we see is smog, littered with one or two sparkling stars.</description>

      <title>On Healthy Escapism</title>

      <guid>https://www.cicadacreativemag.com/blog/escapism/</guid>
      <description>Escapism gets a bad rap, understandably so. It’s often perceived as someone running away from their feelings by refusing to engage with reality&amp;ndash;an unhealthy coping mechanism. Conventional wisdom says that the Right Way™ to deal with negative emotions is to feel all of it and work through the weeds of it. Maybe you talk it out with friends, have a good cry, or draw a bubble bath. I’ve tried all that. It makes me feel worse.</description>

      <description>Sometimes stress can take hold of you, reaching its withering hands around your body, plucking at your heartstrings like it’s playing guitar. If you’re like me (unprepared and disorganized), then the beginning of the school year can be particularly stressful. The stress monster can linger at the corner of your eyes, fading into a haze when you try to look at it head on.</description>

      <title>That time Andy Warhol plagiarized Yayoi Kusama</title>

      <description>If you asked a stranger to list any 5 artists off the top of their head, odds are good that Andy Warhol would be one of them. A soup can homage even sits in front of CSU’s Center for the Arts (to honor a visit from Warhol in 1981). There is no doubt that his contributions altered the trajectory of American art. He also copied part of one of Yayoi Kusama’s exhibitions.</description>

      <description>The Punk Movement was largely male-dominated, as much of the music industry is, but the women of Punk embodied the movement wholly and didn&amp;rsquo;t receive adequate credit. The movement’s female artists highlighted the struggles of the female experience that didn&amp;rsquo;t fit into the mainstream narrative. In their focus on anger and style of dressing, the women of the Punk Movement pushed back against societal norms more effectively than the more popular male bands could.</description>

      <description>In my many years as a creative-driven being, I’ve discovered that I have a great affinity for tattoo art. Tattoo practice is something that is taboo in our society because of its permanence. However, tattoo artists are just as credible as other artists, and their art is worthy of admiration and respect! Especially because there is much effort and tireless work that goes into being a professional tattoo artist.</description>

      <description>Anyone visiting an art museum or studying art history has probably encountered a weirdly shaped baby at some point in their life. These long-limbed babies, resembling a small man or wrinkly sock puppet, are a common staple of art from the Middle Ages all the way up into the Renaissance.</description>

      <description>Nature is out there! (and it can help with your health and creativity, too!) Peyton Farnum, Creative Team Member With all the craziness that 2020 has brought, it can be difficult to remember to take some time to care for yourself. Luckily, I am here to inform you that one of the easiest ways to do so is remarkably simple: spend some time outside!
Nature is all around us. It is something that is irreplaceably beautiful in our world, but it serves more than just aesthetic purpose.</description>

      <description>Art  changes throughout time, evolving to address each century’s unique  struggles and values. In an effort to retaliate against the cynicism of a  post-war era, modern writers began to pioneer a new age of writing  which they called New Sincerity.</description>

      <description>Sometimes  college is the place where we lose it—it not referring to virginity,  house keys, parental respect, or mental stability. Hard as it is to  admit, I myself have lost it more than once here, despite the fact that  I’ve spent a lot of money to become an undergrad and curate it, in hopes  of making it marketable.</description>

      <description>I miss sitting in front of a real person and hearing them lecture, but even more than that I miss the ten minutes before class where I could talk to my peers, catch up on current world news, and orient myself with where everyone else was in their projects (was I behind?). I’ve had no trouble getting access to lectures and asking questions through zoom, but I miss the sense of community formed by a classroom joke. Education is such a social thing, which virtual education just can’t replicate.</description>

      <description>As you all know, COVID. In response to the lack of in-person interaction, many colleges and universities have begun to use proprietary software to ensure students do not cheat during exams, most often ProctorU, Proctorio, and ExamSoft. I take 3 issues with this development.</description>

      <description>In an era of political turmoil and and misinformation, it is more important than ever to critically evaluate and critique the news media we consume. Even traditionally trustworthy news sources are not immune to bias and manipulation. Not only must we be vigilant with the accuracy of the information we consume, we must also be aware of what we’re not being told&amp;ndash;what context is being left out? What stories are being buried? What stories are being pushed? What loaded language is being used?</description>

      <description>We all love to imagine design as the industry of the future–innovative, inclusive, progressive.  However, this field is just as prone to racial inequality as any other industry in America, if not moreso. Just check out page 14 of the 2019 AIGA Design Census. Because of this, it is imperative that we begin to recenter the conversation. White designers in the industry have an obligation to elevate our Black peers. You can start by checking out the amazing designers and organizations that I’ve listed in this Quick List for Cicada’s September newsletter.</description>

      <title>The Unity of Form in Layli Long Soldier&#39;s &#39;Obligations 2&#39;</title>

      <description>Layli Long Soldier’s “Obligations 2” is adventurous with form. This poem confronts us with choices we must make as the reader; we can take a path through the middle, or through the edges, or a combination of both. We can read top to bottom, and we can read left to right. We can read and re-read and re-read and find a new poem each time. Whatever we do, we’re presented with the enigma of choice.</description>

      <title>The Shadow Pandemic: The Worldwide Increase in Domestic Abuse</title>

      <description>When global lockdowns were put into place, the world felt a little safer with the pandemic seemingly contained; however, closed doors and 24/7 confinement bred a much more sinister affliction. The UN has depicted the worldwide increase in domestic violence as a &amp;ldquo;shadow pandemic&amp;rdquo; parallel to COVID-19, saying cases of domestic abuse during the pandemic have increased by 20 percent.These numbers can only reflect the reported cases. Stress and isolation generate incendiary tensions and an absence of privacy subjects many survivors to more intimate scrutiny by their abuser, making it hard to reach out for help.</description>

      <description>Where we live is a mess. It’s a convoluted, poorly meshed, dig-until-your-hands-break country. It was a rug ripped out from under those who called it home, and now it is a capitalist petri dish. It’s hard to agree on things here, even with ourselves.</description>

      <title>Regarding “Ching Chong House” and Anti-Asian Racism in the Wake of COVID-19</title>

      <description>Early in July, a fake restaurant emerged on Instagram and Yelp. This fake restaurant was entitled “Ching Chong House” and had various racist menu items ranging from Corona cocktails to “Crispy Burnt Pug.” Although it is clear that this stunt is merely another in a long list of unfunny edgy shock humor devoid of any creativity or actual comedy, it is still worth examining given the social context we find ourselves in.</description>

      <description>In a few weeks, millions of students will be returning to school for the fall. Despite the current COVID-19 pandemic with cases on the rise again, most schools are planning on having at least some in-person learning. For parents, this requires them to make a tough decision on whether or not to send their children to school- or to opt for online only options.</description>

      <description>Social media has acted as a primary source of information, education, and organization throughout the Black Lives Matter movement since the its inception in 2013. It has been a platform for people to share and promote speakers, books, funds and organizations. Mass participation can create a sense of unity, community, and wide-reaching support, but done ingenuously, it can run the risk of being noise. Adding to a discussion doesn’t always mean you’re listening, and it’s easy to share recommending book lists without any intention to read them for yourself.</description>

      <description>The spring of 2004 raised two kinds of children. I, a proud four and a half year old, spent my time playing outside with toys and picking apart the lawn while a swath of angsty 17 year olds also emerged into the open air, ready to scream all summer long.</description>

      <description>In the midst of yet another reckoning with the antiblackness that permeates every corner of the U.S., many people have scrambled for ways to make sense of it all. For some, it is a familiar topic of conversation, one that has shaped their entire life. For others, it is an abstract knowledge they may only be exploring for the first time.</description>
