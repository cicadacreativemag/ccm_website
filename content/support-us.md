# SUPPORT US
> Help keep independent publishing sustainable by donating to CCM today.

CCM has always been fueled by community support. Without all of you, we wouldn't be able to maintain a space for unconventional and emerging creative work. If our mission resonates with you, you can support us with donations through Ko-fi or Paypal for one-time or recurring support, or via Fractured Atlas, where donations are tax-deductible. Every dollar will be funnelled directly back into CCM—to pay staff, support submitters, and fund our hosting.

As a thank you, donors who contribute $10 or more will be recognized on our Contributors Page. Every dollar makes a difference—if you believe in what we’re building, consider supporting us today!
