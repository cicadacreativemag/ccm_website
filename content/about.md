{{<  cards/card-medium title="Mission Statement">}}
Our goal is cultivate a creative community that spans disciplines and backgrounds. Our primary method of doing this is by publishing a curated collection of community-sourced creative work. We use our online platform to publish experimental and multidisciplinary work, providing a home for ideas that may struggle to fit in other spaces. Cicada aims to keep a low barrier of entry and a high standard of quality.

{{< cards/card-medium title="Our Origins">}}
Cicada was founded in 2018, the brainchild of seven undergraduate students at Colorado State University. We wanted to assemble something new: a creative magazine accessible to all CSU undergraduate students across all disciplines. At the time, our on-campus publications were open only to a sliver of students based on GPA or major, and most literary magazines focus exclusively on writing and/or visual art. We believe these limitations stifle creativity and expression. There is artistry in science, in math, in lines of code â€” and we wanted to include it all.

We've evolved a lot since our first meetings at a coffee shop on the corner of campus, but our core mission has never wavered. Instead, it has expanded. When the COVID-19 pandemic moved the world online in 2020, we adapted and went fully remote, opening our submissions to undergraduates everywhere.

And as of Issue 07, _anyone_ can submit to CCM and apply for staff.

Submissions open twice a year, typically in the spring and fall. We organize editorial teams to review anonymized submissions and vote on what we think should be included in the issue. Then, we publish a carefully crafted issue of your work.

We acknowledge that art doesn't always come box-shaped, perfectly ready to fall into a category. Cicada Creative Magazine exists to showcase that artistic exploration and novelty.

We hope to broadcast each and every way you make your mark on our world.
