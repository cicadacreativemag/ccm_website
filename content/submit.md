# SUBMIT

## Submissions for Issue 07 are currently open! Submit your work [here](https://forms.gle/PPJT4JQotExjhX7f6).

This issue's theme is **Time**. The passage of time doesn't always feel coherent. It can be thick and slow, stretching a work shift into a seemingly unending night. It can also be so quick it feels like months have slipped by in a matter of days. In a world comprised of deadlines, it can feel like time looms over everything we do. And it always seems to be running out. 

But anxiety isn't the only thing time offers us. We are constantly in flux, evolving and growing with every passing moment. Who you are is a product of the time you've spent in this world, and we invite you to meditate on all the ways it influences you. Submissions do not need to strictly adhere to this theme. Think of it more as a suggestion or a starting point. 

Here at CCM, weâ€™ve branded ourselves as more than a literary magazine. We aim to reach beyond traditional definitions of art and writing. So, we've reimagined artistic categories as the following:

- **Auditory**
    - Music recordings
    - Spoken poetry/writing
- **Spatial**
    - Topography and GIS
    - Architectural layouts
    - Interior design
    - Physical installations
- **Language**
    - Poetry, flash fiction, etc.
    - Reporting or feature writing
    - Written sheet music
- **Visual**
    - Computer generated images
    - Culinary art
    - Games
    - Programming
    - Textiles, clothing, and fashion design
    - Cosmetology
- **Cultural/Social**
    - Cultural essays and research
    - Field notes and creative data

You can combine elements of these categories -- several of the examples we provided can fall into multiple categories, and we encourage you not to let these categories limit you. If you are able to create work that exists completely outside of these categories, we will gladly review your submitted work with care and openness.
