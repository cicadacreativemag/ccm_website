{{< cards/card-medium title="Submission Guidelines">}}
Submissions that fail to adhere to submission guidelines will not be considered for publication.

*   Please only submit **once** per issue cycle. The maximum number of pieces you can include in your submission is **three**.
*   Writing submissions should not exceed 1500 words each.
*   We allow simultaneous submissions. If another magazine accepts your piece, please notify us as soon as possible.
*   We allow previously published work as long as you have the rights to it. Please clarify this on your submission and include a source to where the work has been previously published. Please ensure the other publication permits the piece to be republished.
*   Our review process is anonymous. Please do not include your name or any other identifying information in the document you submit.
*   If you are submitting visual art, please submit high-quality images (1500 px on long edge, 300 ppi recommended). We value quality documentation. Even if we like a piece, if the documentation is poor (low resolution, shaky, dimly lit), its odds of being published are low.
*   Our submission form will accept file sizes up to 10MB per submission. If your files exceed this limit (as might be the case for audio recordings or videos), please email us so we can figure out an alternative.
