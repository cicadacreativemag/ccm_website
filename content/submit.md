{{< cards/card-medium title="Submission Guidelines">}}
*   The maximum number of pieces anyone can submit to CCM (or have published) per issue is **three**.
*   Staff members may submit to CCM, but must abstain from reviewing it and cannot disclose it is theirs.
*   Staff members also cannot review or vote on pieces that are created by someone they know.
*   There is a 5,000 word limit on writing.
*   We allow simultaneous submissions.
*   Work may be previously published, but you must clarify this on your submission and include a source as to where the work has been previously published. Please also ensure the other publication permits you to re-publish the piece.
*   It does not cost money to submit to CCM.
*   We value documentation. Even if we like a piece, if the documentation is poor (low resolution, shaky, dimly lit), its odds of being published are lower.
*   Our submission form will accept file sizes up to 10MB per submission. If your files exceed this limit (as might be the case for audio recordings or videos), please email us so we can figure out an alternative.
    *   If you are submitting visual art, please be sure to submit high-quality images. 150 to 300 ppi is ideal. However, please be mindful of space considerations. Try to keep your images under 3MB.
*   _Note on AI-generated work:_ AI-generated work is not allowed unless it involves substantial human creativity or transformative modification beyond simple prompting and generation. If AI-tools are used, they must be disclosed. If you are unsure whether your work falls within accepted use, please email us at info@cicadacreativemag.com.
