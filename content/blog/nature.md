# Nature is out there! (and it can help with your health and creativity, too!)
## Peyton Farnum, Creative Team Member

With  all the craziness that 2020 has brought, it can be difficult to  remember to take some time to care for yourself. Luckily, I am here to  inform you that one of the easiest ways to do so is remarkably simple:  spend some time outside!

Nature  is all around us. It is something that is irreplaceably beautiful in  our world, but it serves more than just aesthetic purpose. Spending two  hours a week outside is proven to have psychological benefits in more  ways than one.¹ Increased time spent in nature can promote a calm sense  of wellbeing, and can also help improve your mood and stimulate the  parts of your brain that control creativity.¹ Us creative people know  that whatever we can get our hands on to help us succeed is vital, and  luckily for us, it’s incredibly accessible! 

Inspiration is  abundant in the outdoor world. Plants, animals and landscapes make  incredible subjects for artwork, as they often come in beautiful shapes  and colors. Sketching some of these will help you sharpen your  observational drawing skills and provide a variety of texture to  replicate!

Fun tip: collect flowers or leaves and press them in your sketchbook! They might make good use in a collage or other projects!

I  painted this back in 2018 during a trip to Nicaragua. I sat in the  shade near the edge of the sand and painted the remarkable visage of the  water and vegetation around me. In the hours I spent creating it, I  felt intensely serene--every breath I took was crisp and all the sounds  of life around me kept a presence of calmness as I worked. It was one of  my favorite experiences of art-making, all because of the natural  environment I chose to surround myself with!

Let this serve as a  friendly reminder to leave our hobbit holes every once in a while and  soak up some quality natural atmosphere. Grab your paints, inks,  pencils, or any art making instrument of your choice and head to your  nearest outdoor location! Feel the grass, listen to the birds or wind,  take a load off under a tree and take some deep breaths. Commemorate the  trip by getting some enjoyable creative work done, or just take some  time to relax. Afterwards, you will hopefully feel more mentally sound  and prepared to tackle any obstacles that lie ahead.

Remember to take care of yourself and enjoy all that earth has to offer!
