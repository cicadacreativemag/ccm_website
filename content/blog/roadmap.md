# Roadmap: What's next?
## Jay Serrano, Editorial Director

Hello, all! It's been a minute. We've been hard at work here at CCM, and a few things have changed. Our Discord server got a makeover, we have the beginnings of some proper documentation, polls for Issue 07’s theme are live, and staff applications are open! But there’s lots more coming.

##### *What's new*:

<section class="py-1">
  <ul class="timeline">
    <li class="timeline-item mb-5">
      <h5 class="fw-bold">Discord server updates</h5>
      <p>
    We've cleaned up the place. Between webhooks, bots, boosts, and upcoming movie nights, we think it's a pretty nice place! You can join us here with this <u><a href="https://discord.com/invite/sgneFPdpNh">link</a></u>.   
    </p>
    </li>

<li class="timeline-item mb-5">
      <h5 class="fw-bold">Staff applications are open!</h5>
      <p>
And will now stay open until they are filled. They are also reviewed on a rolling basis. We are currently filling Editorial Board vacancies (Web Developer, Managing Editors, Editorial Assistant, and Communications Director) and seeking Creative Team Members. Reminder! Anyone above the age of 18 can now apply. For more information, you can check the <code>#staff-applications</code> channel on Discord or look at our <u><a href="https://docs.cicadacreativemag.com/docs/staff-and-membership/">documentation.</a></u> </p>
    </li>

<li class="timeline-item mb-5">
      <h5 class="fw-bold">Documentation</h5>
      <p>
Speaking of which, we now have some <u><a href="https://docs.cicadacreativemag.com/docs/">documentation</a></u> for staff, prospective staff, and any curious readers. It's still under construction, but we're working on it.</p>
    </li>

<li class="timeline-item mb-5">
      <h5 class="fw-bold">Issue 07 theme poll</h5>
      <p>
We pitched theme concepts and voted amongst ourselves, and the top two were:

- **Waste**: kitsch, hot messes, waste of time/space, decadent disgust
- **"You are here"**: maps, wayfinding, identity
    </p>
<p>
Visit our Twitter or Instagram to vote and help break the tie. In next month's newsletter, we'll announce the winner and open submissions for Issue 07!

      <p class="fw-bold">April 2023</p>
      <p>
    Introducing the long awaited virtual workshop! It will be structured similarly to review: anyone who signs up for workshop will receive a packet of peer-submitted poetry to look over. Then, we will hold a voice call where we can discuss that poetry in greater detail for the next 2 hours. Will take place on Discord.
