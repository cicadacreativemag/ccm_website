Hello, everyone! We're hard at work reviewing your submissions, and we want to thank you for entrusting us with your work. It's an honor and a privilege. As you may already know, our original deadline for submissions this issue cycle was set for May 10, which is only two days away.

However, as this date has crept nearer, we started to have some concerns. We held a meeting and unanimously decided that it would be better to extend this issue cycle rather than trying to push out an issue we aren't satisfied with. We think you all deserve better, and so we'll do our best to make the wait worth your while. This issue is planned to be our most ambitious yet, and as we experiment with new review processes, technologies, and marketing tactics, we're excited to bring our vision to life.

The new submissions deadline is **November 1**, and Issue 08 will now be released in **December**. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, especially to our submitters who will have to wait much longer than anticipated to see their work published. However, we believe this is the best option to ensure publication quality. 

As a reminder, our [email campaign](https://tally.so/r/wd6egr) is still open, as are our submissions. Issue 09 will be postponed until early 2025. We already have a lot of plans in store for Issue 09, so please look forward to it. 

We thank you for your continued patience. We will do our best to make this wait worth your while, and if you have any questions, we're always reachable via [email](mailto:info@cicadacreativemag.com) or our [contact form](https://cicadacreativemag.com/contact/).
