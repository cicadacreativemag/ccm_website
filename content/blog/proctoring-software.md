# Proctoring software is a nightmare for students. It doesn’t have to be this way.
> Jay Serrano, Editorial Director


As
 you all know: COVID. In response to the lack of in-person interaction, 
many colleges and universities have begun to use proprietary software to
 ensure students do not cheat during exams, most often ProctorU, 
Proctorio, and ExamSoft. I take 3 issues with this development:

**1.) This is spyware.**

When you require students to install software that quite literally watches them, that is spyware. 

“Spyware
 describes software with malicious behavior that aims to gather 
information about a person or organization and send such information to 
another entity in a way that harms the user; for example by violating 
their privacy or endangering their device's security.” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware))

Modern
 tech’s propensity for obsessive surveillance has become increasingly 
difficult to combat and virtually impossible to avoid. However, one 
would hope higher institutions would advocate for things like data 
privacy and personal agency. Instead, the director of academic testing 
services at Utah State University lightheartedly described Proctorio as 
“sort of like spyware that we just legitimize.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/))
 The University of Arizona’s assistant director of technology &nbsp;insisted 
students don’t mind because “they know this is an expectation because 
their professors put it out there.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, the student 
body says otherwise. ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21232777/examity-remote-test-proctoring-online-class-education)) &nbsp;Additionally, the chief executive of Proctorio reflected on the situation with a dystopian, “we’re the police.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/)) 

I
 could spiral into a separate tangent about how the US obsession with 
policing and instinct to punish accelerates the meritocratic rot of late
 stage capitalism under collaborative neoliberal and fascist rule, but 
suffice to say that no academic software should ever be comparing itself
 to law enforcement. That’s how dystopian horror movies start. Putting 
aside this horrendously inappropriate take, violating student privacy is
 a pattern—schools force us to engage with abusive proprietary software 
every day. Whether it’s opting us into a relationship with Google via 
school Gmail accounts, forcing students to have accounts with Adobe 
Creative Cloud as a requisite for even being able to engage with a 
course, or holding office hours via Microsoft Teams, there is an 
insidious drip of our data that is all being funneled through people who
 want to profit from it. All of these companies have been revealed to be
 astonishingly abusive with data. [Google](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/tech/google-street-view-privacy-lawsuit-settlement/index.html) [alone](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-gmail-data-sharing-email-inbox-privacy-scandal-a8548941.html) [would](https://www.cnet.com/news/google-sued-over-keeping-location-data-amid-privacy-concerns/) [take](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/06/23/google-confirms-creepy-new-privacy-problem/#6587d31f9d8b) [an](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/google-wifi-street-cars-spy-lawsuit-settlement,39998.html) [entire](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-exposed-user-data-feared-repercussions-of-disclosing-to-public-1539017194) [new](https://www.politico.eu/article/google-data-breach-privacy-data-protection/) [post](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-privacy-lawsuit-idUSKBN23933H) to cover (4 lawsuits and counting). 

I
 don’t expect universities to be a beacon of free and open-source 
software, especially given how frankly inconvenient most FOSS is. But I 
also don’t expect them to gleefully make it worse. Proctor software 
requires a webcam to view (and, usually, tour) a student’s living space 
and often uses biometrics to track their physical motion; it often 
features facial recognition and eye tracking. It also records the event 
and human proctors may be able to remotely control the student’s 
machine. ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/01/online-proctoring-college-exams-coronavirus/))
 It seems almost absurd to have to explain the Orwellian nature of this 
type of surveillance, but in case this wasn’t clear: allowing for-profit
 companies to record and monitor students in their private living spaces
 because they might look up a Calculus formula is absolutely unhinged.

**2.)
 It isn’t an effective measure for cheating and does not account for 
students with disabilities or, really, the majority of people.**

One
 of the most infamous features of this type of software is that it 
tracks eye movement and physical motion. These are, perhaps, pretty easy
 behaviors to latch onto as signs of academic dishonesty. But, as is 
often the case, the easiest path is also the laziest and least 
thoughtful. The assumption that darting eyes and excessive motion are 
indicators of dishonesty is a lazy one that perpetuates ableist beliefs 
and assumptions. &nbsp;Students with ADHD may have a difficult time sitting 
still or staring directly at the monitor. Students with anxiety may need
 periods of time to readjust, perhaps closing their eyes to re-center. A
 student on the autism spectrum may need to [stim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimming)
 during an exam. Students with chronic pain and/or fatigue may need to 
take breaks to stretch or struggle with uncomfortable seating (hi, 
that’s me.) [As one student reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/testing-schools-proctorio.html),
 she struggles with tics, particularly in stressful situations (such as 
exams), which puts her in a situation where she is being recorded in a 
vulnerable moment as she struggles with her disability, which she 
describes as embarrassing. 

Even neurotypical students often 
fidget (clicking a pen, shaking a leg, etc.) It’s a very normal response
 to stress and hyper-concentration. [Several](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22711579/) [peer-reviewed](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101115155756.htm) [studies ](https://slate.com/human-interest/2017/05/johns-hopkins-memory-game-shows-how-motion-affects-memory-and-cognition.html)indicate
 that motion can be an effective tool to aid memory retrieval and 
clearer cognition. There is no reason to flag this as a suspicious or 
negative behavior, either in person or virtually. The only reason to 
discourage this behavior is for their benefit--it is much easier to 
identify any behavior other than the strictly prescribed one than it is 
to actually prioritize all students’ learning. Conventional academic 
settings are notoriously unfriendly to neurodivergent students and are 
often directly detrimental to the professed goals of teaching and 
learning. This is very much an institutional problem. It is just even 
more glaring and naked when distilled in this way--when given the choice
 between letting students learn comfortably (requiring some 
recalibration of course material) and forcing disabled students to be 
recorded by a software that is trained to view them as inherently 
suspicious, universities chose the latter. 

To refocus and 
summarize: This software strips students of effective coping tools to 
take a test and hinders their academic performance.

So far, we’ve 
identified two ways this software works to the detriment of students and
 have identified zero ways it works to our benefit. At this point, we 
must ask: “Who does this serve?”

**3.) This is a byproduct of institutional laziness that does not value its undergraduate students.**

We
 have access to all the information we could ever need to perform our 
tasks competently, rendering many old testing styles archaic and 
impractical. Of course, we should have some working knowledge, but most 
of us will not be in situations where we have 2 minutes to recall the 
types of fault lines of the North American plate. 

It demonstrates
 a broader issue: universities take their undergraduate students for 
granted; they fleece us for money we don’t have under the pretense that 
good education costs good money, then refuse to intervene when they do 
not deliver on that promise. We’re forced to spend inordinate amounts of
 money on textbooks—an 88% increase between 2006 and 2016 ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/6/18252322/college-textbooks-cost-expensive-pearson-cengage-mcgraw-hill))—and
 additional equipment like clickers (which are usually just used to take
 attendance). We have little recourse when our professors (especially 
tenured professors) implement abusive practices. But we make these 
institutions run. Without undergraduate students, every single one of 
these universities would go under. The institutional arrogance and 
entitlement seems to grow every day, becoming harder and harder to 
ignore. But we--and more importantly, they--know college is [the single most important tool for upward class mobility](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/social-mobility-memos/2014/02/11/does-college-really-improve-social-mobility/).
 As the casualties of late stage capitalism’s death rattle, we have no 
choice. It’s why they do it--they know they’ll get away with it. They 
know we have nowhere else to go. 

In this specific context, I 
understand the burden of reconfiguring a course is not an easy one to 
shoulder and I do not expect professors to suddenly have all the 
answers. However, by introducing this software, the professor shifts 
this burden to this student--again. It is not our burden to bear--again.
 We’re struggling as well—there is no need to make it worse. 

**Where do we go from here?**

Some
 of my fellow Cicadas pointed out I left this on a fairly depressing 
note. Although I am determinedly cynical, I don’t think there’s any harm
 in sharing some ideas.

Proctoring software is generally used for 
summative assessments, which evaluates student learning at a given 
benchmark, like a midterm or a final exam. These are high stakes, which 
means there is a high incentive to cheat, hence the proctors. Formative 
assessments are lower stakes, things like a quick summary of a lecture 
or a mini-quiz. Formative assessments aid learning and summative 
assessments measure learning. Conventional wisdom says both are 
necessary. A trickle of research has indicated that this may not be the 
case and this teacher makes[ a very compelling case](http://fearlessteachers.com/what-if-there-were-no-summative-assessments/) as for why summative assessments might not even be necessary anymore. 

That
 in mind, the most logical way to resolve this proctoring issue would be
 to eliminate time-based, closed note summative tests. There are many 
ways to achieve this

**Solution #1: More (formative) testing.**

I
 think almost everyone can identify with the “cramming for a test” 
experience. You sit down at 11:00 PM to engage with the material for the
 first time before your 8:00 AM exam. If you’re like me, maybe you’re 
only just now reading the textbook (oops). You open Quizlet and stare at
 the screen till your eyes hurt. Is it too late to email the professor a
 clarification question? You sleep for 3 hours, remorsefully wobbling 
your way through the test as you desperately chug the dregs of your 
coffee. You leave the room and feel overwhelming relief. You pass the 
test and learn almost nothing. 

Henry L. Roediger III, a famous cognitive psychologist known for his research on memory, asserts the following: [fast learning leads to fast forgetting](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/learning-through-testing).
 Cramming is popular because it works. At least, long enough to get 
through the test. His study reveals that self-testing is an incredibly 
effective tool for learning, but that it is not leveraged in a 
productive way. He elaborates on a concept known as the “testing effect”
 and studies better testing practices, all of which you can find [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-6916.2006.00012.x). 

Basically,
 he asserts that one day of intense formative assessments was so 
effective for learning that it enabled the student to survive a 
summative assessment. In other words, many times, a cramming situation 
occurs because the formative assessments either did not happen or they 
were not effective,

How to implement/Examples: 

*   Quizzes
 can be embedded into lecture videos using Canvas. Every lecture couldbe split into multiple videos, each one with graded, embedded quizzes.
*   This could be a weekly quiz that goes over lecture material. Maybe this quiz has 2-3 attempts and records the highest score.

**Solution #2: No memory-based testing.**

If
 summative exams are really necessary, there are other ways to measure 
mastery of the material. One could argue that assessments such as 
recitals and other performances require a component of memory, but 
generally, performance-based summative assessments are an accumulation 
of all you’ve learned and retain the pressure of a traditional exam 
without requiring a proctor.

Have you ever taken notes so 
desperately you didn’t actually absorb what was said? Have you ever just
 listened to a lecture and been surprised at how much you absorbed? Our 
fear of not remembering something we’ll need on an exam can be extremely
 distracting. However, if you can focus on the lecture completely 
without being distracted, you can have a more meaningful recollection of
 the material. Maybe you don’t remember Crime and Punishment was 
published in 1866, but you do remember that it was published in a 
serialization for 12 months in the 1800s. 

**How to implement/Examples:**

*   Essays
 take the place of traditional exams. Instead of a time-based huntthrough the treasure trove of young adult memory, a student can taketheir time to sort through the information they’ve been presented andcreate a unique response. This does, of course, have its own host ofchallenges and should be treated carefully, but essays could just aseasily measure mastery.
*   Perhaps a class could be conductedalmost entirely through discussions and direct engagement. After everysingle lecture, you post a summary of what you learned with 3 questions.
 This is a type of formative testing that could replace mini-quizzes and
 other memory based assessments.
