**1. Enrico Robusti**

An Italian painter, Enrico Rbusti 
completed a degree in Law before starting a career in the arts. Although
 the paintings don’t have typical gothic elements, I think there's 
something wonderfully horrifying about his style.

Known better under his pseudonym Norman Leto, Lukasz Banach was born in Poland and was a self-taught artist interested in both painting and video production. He became friends with Zdzislaw Bekinski (a painter towards the bottom of this list), who influenced his form and style.

**4. Valerie Patterson**

Valerie Patterson uses primarily watercolor to enliven her paintings. Although her paintings are much more psychedelic than gothic, her works still have an eerie feel to them.

**6. Zdzisław Beksiński**

My personal favorite on this list, Zdzisław Beksiński was a Polish artist. Although his paintings display gothic and utopian elements, Beksiński was recorded as being a positive and pleasant man who refused to analyze his own paintings or attribute one sole meaning onto them. Zdzisław Beksiński was stabbed to death in 2005 by a 19-year-old presumably because he refused to lend the boy 100 dollars.
