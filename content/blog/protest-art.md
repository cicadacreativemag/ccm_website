**2012 - Theaster Gates, Minority Majority**

Gates uses fire hoses in his work to speak on the history of race in the United States and violence against black Americans. By using fire hoses, his art alludes to the violent use of such tools towards the peaceful civil rights protesters. Though the same materials may no longer be used, this violence is still prominent today.

**2014 - Kara Walker, A Subtlety…**

Walker’s sculpture features a larger than life sphinx figure made entirely of sugar, portraying a racist stereotype of black women. The use of sugar and installing the sculpture in a form or sugar factory alludes to the history of slavery in the industry in the United States, and the objectification and fetishization of black women.
