# 7 Arbitrary Ways to Stay Creative at Home 
## Haley Arnold, Social Media Manager

It’s 2021, and COVID is still in full swing. With cities encouraging us to continue social distancing, work from home and limit our activity outside of the home, it can be hard to stay entertained and feel motivated. At this point we have all moved on from whipped coffee and sourdough bread, so here are 10 other ideas on how to be creative at home!

1. Learn a Tik Tok dance

No, you are not too old for Tik Tok! Challenge yourself to learn one of those 15 second dances you’re seeing all over the internet! Send it to your friends and challenge them to learn it as well. You don’t have to be a good dancer to appreciate the art of a 16 year old’s choreography, and believe it or not those bite sized dances prove to work up a sweat! Better yet, make up your own!

2. Make a music video

Put on your favorite song at the moment, break out the props, and have your main character moment. Film yourself lip syncing and feeling yourself in a few different areas of your house. Then breakout those editing skills you have from when you thought you were going to be a Youtube star back in middle school and work your magic. The worse quality, and more chaotic energy the better. You never know, you could receive a call from SZA asking you to star in her Good Days music video. 

3. Try drag makeup 

Once you’ve binged all 13 seasons of RuPaul’s Drag Race, you should have a good understanding of how it’s done. Breakout the glue stick and fake eyelashes and get to painting. If you still don’t feel prepared, go watch all 5 seasons of All Stars and come back. Or follow one of Trixie Mattel’s many tutorials on Youtube. Don’t forget to contour that nose and glue down your wig. 

4. Go for a walk and make up full life stories about the people who live in the houses you pass

It’s a little hard to people watch when there are no people to watch. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make up stories about imaginary people living in the houses you see on your neighborhood walk. Who are they? What are their relationships to each other? Sometimes you might get lucky and see someone in the yard that can give you a starting prompt.

5. Organize your closet by color

Maybe this only sounds fun to me because I am a Virgo… Just remember ROY G BIV.

6. Make outfits for your pet

Cut holes in that old sock that’s been missing its pair for the last three years but you can’t bring yourself to get rid of, and turn it into a sweater for your guinea pig, rat, bunny, rat dog or other small animal. Or crochet or sew a gown for your dog. Fabric glue is a great alternative for those of us who are lacking the domestic skills of sewing or knitting. Our poor dogs are ready for us to go back to work...

7. Learn a new language

Prepare for those trips you’ve been dreaming about taking for the past 10 months, or brush up on those 4 years of a language you took in high school and somehow have forgotten all of. Or make up your own language with your roommates. After 10 months of being stuck in the house with them, I’d be surprised if you didn’t already have one (perhaps a non-verbal, body language, leave me alone glare, type of language).
