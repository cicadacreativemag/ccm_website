summary: I miss sitting in front of a real person and hearing them lecture, but even more than that I miss the ten minutes before class where I could talk to my peers, catch up on current world news, and orient myself with where everyone else was in their projects (was I behind?). I’ve had no trouble getting access to lectures and asking questions through zoom, but I miss the sense of community formed by a classroom joke. Education is such a social thing, which virtual education just can’t replicate.
