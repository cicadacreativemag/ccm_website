Thank you to everyone who participated in the review cycle for Issue 08: "Dial-up Dreams." We are hard at working preparing the issue for publication, which will be released here later this month. We will announce the publication via newsletter, social media, and in our RSS feed. Stay creative, and we hope this issue delivers everything you hoped for and more. Stay tuned for announcements regarding Issue 09!
