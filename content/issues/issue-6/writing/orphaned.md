Orphaned.  
No one sheds a tear for an orphaned child. Not when it's me.  
But you wonder who my parents are  
And it picks at their brains  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An insatiable itch  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An insatiable itch  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A invoiceable fear that I am yours  
The accident child  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Borne from a single moment   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A rogue campfire spark  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A quick mistake  
Or maybe I’m not yours  
But borne from lightning  
And a quick moment when electricity meets the earth

And you can wipe the sweat off your brow  
And try to ignore the fact that you fed me  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Didn’t you?

Didn’t you leave the air arid for my lips?  
Buy all your material? All you things? All your plastic?  
Didn’t you hold it like an umbrella over me? So no rain would kill me?  
Didn’t you build a crib when you made the earth hot and dry?  
Are you mad at me for lying in it?  
Didn’t it come from your will?  
Why don’t you love me?

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Am I an orphan?  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are you my mom?  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are you my dad?  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Didn’t you make me?  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aren’t you my family?  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aren’t you my family?  
Aren’t you my family? Aren’t you my family?Aren’t you my family?Aren’t you my family? Aren’t you my family?Aren’t you my family?Aren’t you my family?Aren’t you my family? Aren’t you my family?
