*As the petals proceed in drift, breathes in silence*   
*a swirling tale of horizon twirls; forever.*

At the door of yesterday's palm, Tao Qian  
strolled through plum blossoms for inner peace.  
The collars wrapped in their own; the  
quasars' nail to the nail's marble mountain,  
And the name stood the rigours of inescapable  
time between the narrow strings of singularity.

*The larvae in the water will never hear the story*  
*of life on the other side.*  

Mere mere, a canvas space-filled  
*chun ju* with thoughts and truths  
and threads tapering down to the  
hidden hexagon with autumn's singing feathers  
spread along long-standing supermassives  
west along the wattle fence and pillars  
thick as Virgo's patterns in vernacular trois;

The First:  
Going back into history  
The Second:  
Coming into the present's path  
The rest of all:  
*Woven into the future's orbit.*
