*I will search for you through a thousand worlds*  
*and lifetimes until I find you.*

The way forth faced within.  
In the rush of rolling currents;  
In the quiet ease, the numb of  
nebulae and golden crystals paved.

As gated veils lulled and lulled;  
lensing in gravitational gamuts â€”  
& there thrust *Shinjin's* forces, lime  
luminous red; some shade of light's  
sight sees the look of Arrokoth  
gliding toward the distant blue

An instant more, the slightest photon  
touched *cygnus'* leaf; peculiar.  
Twirls in twos, it twists;  
like the eyes of a curious child  
monitoring the stars drift and drift  
away to the belly of a thousand waves.

*I will wait for you in all of them.*
