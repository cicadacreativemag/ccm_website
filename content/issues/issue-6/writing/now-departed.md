Thus departed Auden, Heaney, or Eliot,  
now resting in hard soil.  
we stand over them, sandalled,  
on spent words and Word:

Now, Christ, my God, hangs on a cross  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in an implacable horizon  
His lips are baked and black.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I trace the labyrinth  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on my common palm,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  “the sign is… burning…”  
before exhaling,  
to move away from what was, and is,  
still, a recognizable face.

~ ~ ~

A real moon over this imaginary garden.  
Gardeners trim the umbilical cords of rugged brown  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with their sleeves un-rolled.

Standing some distance away from them,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the twigs still shine an unoffending glow.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood-plastered garden, foreshadowed bodies of decay,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but we stand sandalled on solid earth.  
We begin to walk easily,  
bow, pray for this wilderness to be  
a promised land.
