What may be more glorious than the sky’s expanse?  
of fibrous clouds / puffy disentombed bodies --  
Roll on! Roll on! Row on.

God walks dully along. / Drowning man  
un-abandoned / until  
one knight comes, a thief arrives  
at this raucous garden with a sword.

Stands before  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; sealed mysteries/  
redundant prophecies/ it is an oblong bible,  
yet, God speaks orotund to the blind.
