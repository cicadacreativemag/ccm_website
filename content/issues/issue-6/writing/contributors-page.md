   With my art, I explore the intangible as well as all the hidden thoughts, fears, and wishes such an undefined space encompasses to make sense of the realities that come with the 21st century. I use mediums including digital art, oil and acrylic paint, and collage. <br><br>

  <em>Rocky Mountain College of Art + Design, 2022<br>
    Fine Art</em><br> <br>
I enjoy a researched based approach which integrates sound as well as sculptural elements in my ideation process. I’m very hands on and because of this I enjoy creating and ideating in multiple mediums (including digital, ceramic, painting, printmaking and photography) in order to create a blended approach to my immersive work as well as my 2D work. Music is also essential in my process and being able to integrate that into my work shapes the direction of my work consistently. <br><br>
