The alarm of a new day on the face of the sun is  
like a new flip to the back of a sheet our soul tapered  
on its edges, and we are left with irregular lumps of pain  
graffiti on the new sheet to remind us of the last. But it's

still like flakes, worth seeing, worthy enough to pump  
alongside our hearts; pain is painted on the inside but  
your cheeks abstaining from grief so the sunset can reflect  
on it at, another 24 hours gone. Another alarming  
24 hours alarmed to the face of the glowing sun, alarming

alarmed its face shimmering remembrance, remembrance  
to be the glow in the darkness of grief, not its candle  
alarming alarmed that there is an eye in the dust our hook  
of a body fit into like the suns get buried under the clouds  
gratify returning bodies, our past prints in this tunnel of the earth

like the sun we grow to see again the flaws of it through  
the telescope we invented from the lens of our inside out  
to see how fast we are running from what we are becoming,  
alarming alarms like cries of a landing bomb in lies  
planted on the bow of my ribs.
