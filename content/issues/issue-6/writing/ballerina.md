You’ll howl forever while I roll my eyes  
Powered by a wind up switch  
Sticking out of the back of my neck  
Like a rogue bone  
Twisted and supposed to rattle my voice box  
But the ill painted ballerina pierced through my tongue does not sing  
Supisd mechanical broken thing  
Just rolls its eyes round and round  
Like a marble loose in its head

And you  
I think you vacuumed your eyes for me  
Cause I hate it when you cry  
So my heart beats downwards like there's a kid inside  
Incessantly bouncing his rubble ball against its floor

You vacuumed your eyes for me

Those red veins, the outline of lightning  
Painted inside your eyelids  
So you dream about storms  
And I blink, I hate to blink  
To dream of the veins scarring your arid eyes

You vacuumed your eyes for me

 And I blink, I hate to blink  
To dream of your veins

Coat my eyelashes in glue  
Reaching up

No. I don’t think we look alike  
You don’t look like me

And I wind up my misfit bone  
But the painting ballerina does not sing  
I only weep unblinkingly
