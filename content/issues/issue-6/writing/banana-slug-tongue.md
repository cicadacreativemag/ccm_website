Too much tongue  
Drips down my throat  
Banana slug  
On a childrens slide  
On the stickiest summer sunday

Playing a drunk jock,  
Death slobbers all over me  
The slime of slurred speech

He's speaking about stifled screams  
They’re now rolling on down through me  
(not nearly as fast as i’m rolling my eyes)

I imagine them washing down the banana slug  
Grimy children at the top of the slide  
Bucket of water fountain water in hand  
Knocking it over in one fell swoooooop

Death’s on his knees  
Grips my waist  
Ear on my stomach  
waiting for the echo  
Poor kid at the bottom of the slide  
Hands cupped sloppily  
Only for the scorching heat to eat the water before it could ever wash his (dirty) hands

But of course they sunk inside of me  
Slowly, without a splash  
Dissolved so effortlessly  
In the pit  
Of my stomach

Your  
head’s still on my belly and  
Your hair is running with grease  
And there's a sunburn on your scalp

Do you know your sunburnt there?  
Or will you wait till the peel of it is caught in your comb

I bend and kiss you there  
Faint smell of a slug stagnant in my spit
