fragment  
“who knew such small rocks could become something so monumental?”

anchored  
“to this desolate landscape. take lessons of resilience, transformation, serenity, from the stones beneath your feet.”

blooming  
“there is much life here when you look. tread lightly on the soil, there are castles here hundreds of years in the making.”
