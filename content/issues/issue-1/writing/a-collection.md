Uku (you) if the cloth  
Rips, and if not I will come  
Climbing down too

Spatially I get it  
But what is death? Bringing apart  
It’s a suffering for you, you’ll driftagain 
Down the bend see you then

Flowers fall en sueño  
El dormir yes falling that  
Dreaming...  
Followers falling on sleeping of  
Hearing distractingly dead beds haunting  
Little crashers slip into space whew  
Pen knives sleep or slice

Absurd absurd  
Partners here novio littlest  
Thing patterns here novia  
Little song; my vision   
Dissolution; my vision  
Retracted; my vision  
Gone in the light of the sun

Partner partner  
Absurdas here girlfriend littlest  
Thing patterns here boyfriend  
Little ring; my tactile  
Coming apart; my tact  
Retract; my retract  
Gone light sol

podéis echar un vistazo a pinturas de cerdos coquetos.  
Do you see now under 3  
Brights it is not under 3  
Brights it is not meant   
To be greater than mine  
To be greater than mine  
I wanted to say darkness under  
The 4 you wanted to say darkness under  
The 4 I see it not under 3  
It is over 


I see my light in a mirror  
I see in dark what is here

In a bulb upside down  
It is off

You’re never gunna know me  
Friend what’s the purse say friend

Little niños see you, it were told,

Little años little, unknowingly like  
Fire off the typeset played off

Post on the headset, it were shown,  
Little shoulders, made knowingly

Never gunna.  Aught we better  
Bigger up the end set the played off  
The table set

Seem yourself (in  
A dream) like you were before.  
Now see lonely  
Bringing darkness unsaid   
littleLovely where have I gone? 

In just the one I   
See ya next time I wanna learn  
To fly safer now like differences between   
Stars. No I misspoke  
Turning turning the gyre  
I spake a ‘million delusions’ wringing

Discordanant (where is speaking) where  
Is form. If she were here she’d be here and she has been barely I am weight I am tension I am grasping tooly let me be!  
Let them leave me! They are not mean. They are not meet. They are no sky for flying oh little line this lady fly it’s gunna fail you it’s gunna bail you. Darn dooly darn dooly
