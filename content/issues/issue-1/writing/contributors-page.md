{{< contributors name="Sienna Bosch" link="https://siennabosch.com/" linktitle="siennabosch.com" statement="In my work I seek to explore materiality. Through my primary medium of fibers, I work to question the traditionally perceived context of textiles. This is achieved through my incorporation of sculptural elements. Textiles, throughout time, have been used in an ever-changing way. They move with us as they rest on our bodies. My work seeks to understand textiles in a new sense. Some work explores how textiles can be locked into place, become immovable, whereas others allow the textile to transform shape, but in a different way than it would on our bodies." piece1="Recollection" piece1link="/issue-1/recollection/" piece1description="Various Yarns, Resin" >}}

{{< contributors name="Nick Tonetti" link="https://instagram.com/nicktonetti" linktitle="@nicktonetti" statement="Hi! I'm Nick. I've been taking pictures on film for almost four years now, and although it can be frustrating (and expensive!) to wait to develop my pictures, it's incredibly rewarding. I'm a big nature person, and I love being able to snap a photo and keep hiking, without having to stop and worry about adjusting a bunch of knobs on a digital camera. Plus, when I finally develop a bunch of rolls of film after a few months of saving them up, it's like a huge gift to myself and I get to see pictures that I had completely forgot about. One of my favorite things about film is the funky effects you can achieve in-camera with no post-processing, such as film burns and double exposures. Outside of taking pictures and hiking, I am an educator at the Environmental Learning Center, I play drums in an amazing local band: Janet Earth, and I'm a huge gardener and spend most of my free days with my tomato plants!" piece1="Alpine Enchantment" piece1link="/issue-1/alpine-enchantment/" piece1description="35mm film photograph" piece2="Red" piece2link="/issue-1/Red/" piece2description="35mm film photograph" piece3="Mans on Mars/Warm Sands" piece3link="/issue-1/mans-on-mars/warm-sands/" piece3description="35mm film photographs" >}}
