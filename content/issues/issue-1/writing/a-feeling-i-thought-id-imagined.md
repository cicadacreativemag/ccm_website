**now**  
my cuticles are stained with lipstick.  
You make me take off my lipstick.  
it’s not for you.  
I don’t count crumbs and  
seek bones for you.  
but still, I’m wondering  
if you would tranquilize me.
 
**then**  
to cheapen is to breathe  
and every mocha is handed over with  
the word obligation written on the blush of your cheek and I started  
to believe that every mocha would have to mean an apology until the day I  
saw a building in London and I realized  
I had only been thinking of the building & I left without  
the piercing pull to turn back toward it. it stays there  
I will go on without it.
 
**away**  
The heaviness and the blindness that attacks when  
you realize you’re looking at someone so breathtaking  
who you’ve dreamed of,  
whose dreams built like a quickening  
heartbeat as you approached it  
and you see it and you leave and then you realize that your  
dream of Michelangelo’s David and your  
memory of Michelangelo’s David are now the  
same in your mind.  
They are so much muddled and easily switched  
that you realize experience has only ever existed in your mind.
 
**a night**  
To dream is to cause your future to decay.  
Sitting in the desert city at night  
I realized the coldness of the early night was warmer than  
the coldness of the early morning. I didn’t dream that part.  
We didn’t know there would be fireworks. We huddled together but were  
separately happy. As each second that passed  
turned memory a red light went up in the sky and I looked  
at my friend, rubied tears on our freckled faces, I knew  
we were giving nothing short of our most absolute selves  
and we let the seconds evaporate
