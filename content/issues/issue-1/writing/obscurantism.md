This is the portion which passed   
from Father to Son  
from God’s close watch. In South Dakota  
they chased a fox  
through wheezing trees. Son’s heart burst when  
father shot the fox   
and left it to rot.

Later, Son will disappoint him,   
march, and skip the war. His  
wife will scratch their car and never  
repaint it.

Sometimes, even now,  
Father sits in bars with others that remain.  
He smiles down  
when they tell tales  
of how the ground started to swell   
when things began to move out of hand,  
towards the end.  
Move like a mutt being hunted,  
one of them says.
