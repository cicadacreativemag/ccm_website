The feeling of a right thumb pressed  
into the center of a left palm - pressure.  
Pressure counts only in contrast and  
spread like a palm tree it’s nothing.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressure counts only in contrast and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a weighted blanket is a nice way  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to cross off limbs one by one,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a reminder that they once didn’t exist.  
To cross off limbs one by one  
a sturdy, sharp saw blade will do;  
hunger will strike back in the morning  
but weightlessness is hard to come by.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunger will strike back in the morning;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a master’s house can be dismantled  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a master’s tools, the stomach  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a dog that eats its own bile.  
With a master’s tools, the stomach  
vivipares tea leaves and black moods  
but isn’t there pressure too?  
Maybe it’s somewhere up in the lungs.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But isn’t there pressure too?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanging from the ceiling, or below the  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night stand that fruit of death looms,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gorging on all the lost limbs.
