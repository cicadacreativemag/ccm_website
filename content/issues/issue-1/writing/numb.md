Legs shift in raw ice  
I conquer sadness  
While your body blankets  
Over the oceanic bedspread  
Peaceful never had a name  
Until it met the slumber  
Of a drunken man who  
In his dreams, lives  
In hazen false memories  
He's doing better lately  
Drinks his heart until he  
Feels less wooden  
Hooded like Robin  
The brave hero of a story  
Never told, unfold the  
Past, it's silent  
What's done is done  
Until you drink it all  
Away, what's done is dead  
To me, destroy your regrets  
Shake away the pain  
But I still want to see  
Something left of you  
Take what's left of me.
