he had two bony thumbs dipped in  
thick red tempera, dark eyes fixed  
attentively on mine. with the grace  
of a god, he smeared those thumbs  
across the sky, streaking red over  
blue over purple over gold. a regal  
violence, a sorrowful sigh, a summer 
night alone.

the moon was nestled in between  
patches of a whipped cream sky,  
floating, disembodied. quietly, he  
removed his fingers from the canvas  
and wiped them off on his pants.

that wasnâ€™t so hard, now, was it? 
he asks.

i drum my fingers against the  
pavement. i guess not.
