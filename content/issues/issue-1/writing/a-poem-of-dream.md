# 早知去年今天日，人无花开再少年

<div align="center">

在一辆公交车上，是8路，  
On the number eight bus.  
*Tearing edges, of the numbers, white bleeding into black*  
秋叶金黄，铺满地，  
The golden leaves, cover the ground.  
*Smokey lines, blurring at a distance in which people burn into the background*  
车从疾驰到缓行，再到急停， 
The bus speeds up before slowing to a stop.  
*Watch reads 11:00, then 9:30, then 12:15, then 4:25, then....*  
“噗”的一声，  
“Chissssssssss”  
*Echoing through the hill of my ears*  
章礼兵、黎花琴上了车；  
I see Zhang Libing and Li Huaqin get on the bus.  
*Sight dim and blurred. Focus on the faces.*   
庄严肃穆地谈话，  
Talking seriously,  
*Tongue heavy with wood*  
我，到他们在的地方，  
I come over to them.  
*Draggin through grit and dust*   
轻轻地问了声好，  
“How are you guys doing?” I breathe.   
*Fire in droplets on my lips*  
他们向我投以异样的目光，  
They look at me weirdly   
*Eyes darting about, mist in my veins*  
像是见到了不愿相遇的学生：   
It seems that they don’t want to see me;  
*Scratching, itching, binding, matching...*  
“呀，是你呀！你怎么会在这里呢？”  
“Ha, it’s you! Why did you come here?”  
*Brushing, wings of feathered damp*  
这是去凤凰山庄的路。  
This is the road to Phoenix Valley.  
*Tendrils crawling but not biting now.*   
我准备去……  
I am going to...  
*Single drop in a lake filled cavern.*   
我不知道，  
I don’t know,   
*Mollymauk Tealeaf. Molly. MT. Empty.*  
我不知道去哪里。  
I don’t know where to go.    
*Wet dirt climbing up and out.*  
“你妈妈呢？”  
“How is your mother?”  
*Light, so small, barely there*  
“妈妈还好吧？”  
“Is your mother doing alright?”  
*It blinks out for a moment.*  
妈妈？  
Mom?  
*Struggling, gnawing, thrashing, gnashing*  
我的妈妈……  
My mother...  
*A small dot of heat, filling my lungs*  
去年，依旧是黄叶漫地；  
Last year, the yellow leaves still littered the ground;  
*Smooth but sharpened edges. Tearing.*  
依旧是在北海花园到凤凰山庄之间，  
Still between Phoenix Valley and Northern Sea Garden.   
*A silver dragon beneath the surface, water raises and crashes.*   
在一栋古老而又威严的欧式建筑包围的花园里， 妈妈跟我说，  
Inside a garden, guarded by old imperial European style buildings, my mom said to me,  
*Closer, inching, crawling, spitting, looming*  
 “花无重开日，人无再少年。”  
“Flowers cannot blossom again, people cannot become young again.”  
 “妈妈，好久没见了呢。”  
“It has been a long time since I last saw you Mother.”  
*Open wide, alone. Grass swaying in the wind.*   
 “张老师可辛苦了呢！全校的人都知道。”  
“My mother, Teacher Zhang, works very hard! Everybody at the school knows it.”   
*A moonlight, casts a shadow of brilliance.*  
 “可不是么，我们都知道，她的儿子在美国，这段时间呀，可不容易了!”  
“It’s true. We all know that her son is in the U.S. It has become so tough for her lately; Her working so hard.”  
*A film along the edges, ungrasping handle within.*   
“能省则省，自己都不舍得买漂亮的衣服了呢，”   
“She tried to save as much money as she could. She did not even want to buy new clothing.”  
车停了，到站了。  
The bus pulls to a halt. We have arrived...   
*Hand in mouth, reaching...reaching...*  
是教育局，  
...at the Education Bureau,  
*a touch of something hard in the film*  
老师们都忙着去批阅卷子呢。  
All the teachers grade exams together, and they are busy.   
*Grasping...but unable to draw out.*   
我下了车，走进了那个花园，  
I get off the bus, then walked into that same garden,   
*Release, the shadow turns to glass*  
看到满地黄叶，  
I see the yellow leaves covering the ground   
*An empty tongue, spews forth light.*   
仿佛，  
It seems that,   
*Glass figurines dancing around me*  
看到了去年，  
I saw, last year,   
*Just out of reach*  
妈妈的身影，  
My mother’s face,  
*Rising but falling, they move farther away*  
听到了，  
I heard,  
*Darkness gives more. Covered in sweat.*   
我临走的时候，妈妈对我的那句嘱托：  
Before I left home, my mom reminds me of our motto:  
*Hands in my face, I cry for her again.*  
花无重开日，人无再少年。  
“As flowers cannot blossom again, neither can we regain our youth.”
