I only wanted to love and not be blamed:

Get her off of the floor  
Quickly  
Before the grout between the tiles  
Runs red  
Before she stiffens  
Into marble

Take her to me  
There is still time  
Before the red runs dry  
And she starts to bleed gold

She is still soft  
I will steal her  
Before you can add more stone to your quarry

Bring her home  
To the hearth  
Where her blood will fertilize the soil  
And the heat will keep her fresh

Out of this holy place  
Devoid of earthly pleasures

Ground her  
She isn’t yours to martyr  
Pull her off of her hook in the corner  
Break the glass that holds her bones

She is no flower  
To be pruned and plucked  
And pressed between the pages  
Of your weathered book

You loved her less when her heart was beating  
When her skin was warm to the touch  
When she chose  
To touch me,

When she traced my stomach with kisses  
And her hands,  
So holy,  
Were stained with my sin

You loved her less when her eyes were on me,  
And her voice,  
So angelic,  
Sang hymns of the snake,  
Not of eden.

Please,  
Don’t put the marigolds over her eyes  
She never liked them  
That’s why our garden is full of lilacs

Please,  
Leave me something  
to put on a chain and hang by my heart

Please,

Let me see her one more time  
Before you wash all  
But the ivory and pearls  
Off the steps  
And into the gutter

You’ve draped her in lace and satin.  
Blue and white.  
Your virgin queen.

She was not your queen,  
And certainly no virgin.
