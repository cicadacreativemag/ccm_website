  <em>University of California, Santa Barbara 2023<br>

   I like creating works that play with the unreal and with what we don't know. I'm drawn to all things nonsensical, from eerie off-putting creatures to dreamlike scenarios. <br><br>

   Lately I've been focused on the past and the future. During the pandemic I started my tarot deck design and it allowed me to open my mind to a new future path. I've been focused on developing that deck into a fully immersive installation utilizing as many mediums and techniques as possible. This has really solidified my process for me and has allowed me to engage in the scholarly research as well as the need to create something that connects me to the viewer and the reader. <br><br>

    Trying to process some of the insanity of the last year through writing has allowed me an outlet that feels like healing. I believe that writing through disempowering experiences can grow into sources of strength. <br><br>

   My art is for myself, but I hope others can look at it and feel something personal. Something they feel deep in their hearts and say "I get it, someone else gets the struggles I have. I exist and feel seen."<br><br>

   Design is intersectional and interdisciplinary, which is something that I find so fascinating. Through my work, I am trying to find a way to make design more personal and relevant to how we experience life. I am constantly thinking about ways for design that promote sustainable practices which I believe can be achieved through an intimate understanding of form and function, the environment, and cultures formed by people. <br><br>

    I believe in writing that translates into doing language that tries to touche the untouchable and tries again to convey that experience, and so I write as to be able to transform nouns into verbs and verbs back into adjectives. <br><br>

   I am an artist with a love for color, a sporadic sense of self, and an affinity for all things wildlife. I am currently finding my artistic groove in the world of printmaking, but I am on a perpetual quest to find the practices that satiate my fantastical curiosities and make me question what I know as an artist.<br><br>
