<div class="d-flex justify-content-between mb-2">
<div class="p-2">

i grasp <br>
broken mirrors, <br><br> 
turn away; <br><br>
try to catch light. <br><br>

by grace, God <br>
      gives me the <br>
      sun. in return, I give <br>
      him my mind. <br><br>

hands cold,<br>
      covered in clay: <br>
      dirty, <br>
      then whisked away. <br><br>

when this vessel speaks,<br>
      i am, <br>
      weak. <br>
      held by its tongue, <br>
      like fake love, <br>
      immersed <br>
      in its soliloquies:<br>
      synecdoches sung <br>
      saccharine, <br>
      like symphonies.<br><br>

Feet that wander towards <br>
      Sodom are<br>
      connected to bodies that
<br><br>

bury their hands <br>
in the mud <br>
and listen to their mouths <br>
beg for more, <br><br>

 Or for <br>
      lies <br><br>

between my lips <br><br>

that<br>
turn up <br>
in slips; <br>
      that<br>
       leave me<br> 
       praying<br><br>

i’ll grip and tether<br>
      this mind,<br>
      packed with restriction and bind.<br><br>

Leaving the circus, <br>
      kissing Sisyphus goodbye.<br><br> 

i’ll <br>
      lay down the chisel. <br><br>

Eject the wreckage, <br><br>
       
one day<br>
      i’ll call it mine.
