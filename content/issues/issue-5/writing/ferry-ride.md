I am submerged in the Then,  
the all-consuming memory  
of my father’s hands, gray  
and bony, struggling to grasp  
the orange cap of a soda bottle–  
trying to twist and missing,  
trying and missing, then twisting

on three – he is no old man  
but now his fingers are confused  
and wandering across the ferry seat  
to me, where my hand is already open  
to take on the role of bottle opener  
or hand holder

my stranger, this gray man  
with sunken eyes and thinning brow  
turns to watch the water pass  
cold and blue outside  
not speaking what he needs  
or what he wants from me  
but I know he knows  
it’s all ending soon

this is where I stay, frozen,  
soul parted from body, always sitting  
on that ferry with the unfamiliar man  
ferry anchor ported in my chest  
holding me in place to caretake  
if only in my mind, forever  
until he withers  
and I can again rejoin the living
