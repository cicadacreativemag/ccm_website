walking stilted: cupping and gripped  
i tried to grab it but it slipped  
between my butterfingers  
(which the punching bag game  
at the gas station told me I had)  
I wanted to run  
from the mud  
layering layers over my brain (stuck between skull and tissue)  
and disembody the worms that grew in the sickly, zero ph garden  
that laches itself onto the top of my neck:

the plowed garden that pulls the strings that instructs my shoulders to tense,  
that urges my chest to climb higher,  
and drops the weight of my stomach until it hungers no longer.

you canâ€™t decapitate a garden  
so you lie on the dirt and heal it with your princess tears  
clutching the polluted ground,  
you accept that which can never be purified:  
always unkempt and too keen at pacifying.

rather than mutilating the dirt  
where the poison slept  
you sacrifice the body as fertilizer  
amalgamate with the earth.

puzzle piece of you,  
maybe jagged but always attached.  
sang lullabies  
and left snug  
in the clay  
and sound  
in the dust.
