is October, 2019. I watch the ochre trees fly past, watch  
his hands grip the top of the wheel, 64-year-old bones on I-75.  
we know he has crickets in his brain. we don’t yet know  
just how many. his chauffeur’s uniform of Levi’s & sweatshirt —  
the color of blueberries — is the same as ever.  
my mother reaches for him. JohnnyJohnnybecarefulplease.  
I curl into the back seat of the Mazda  
Tribute to when he didn’t slam so hard on the brakes.  
his exhales bleed frustration he cannot transmit. distance  
& judgement glitch on the radio. there is something  
interfering with the broadcast. even my playlists can’t  
drown out the memory of the days this 5-hour drive  
was safe.

we find a parking spot. visit a garden of lazure painting &  
a house full of spent roses. my mother whispers, Johnny’s  
getting worse. I wonder how soon it will be before he loses  
the word daughter, like these roses lost their petals, like  
key & parking brake & transmission turned to  
thick engine oil in his pre-frontal cortex  
before they could make it to his throat.
