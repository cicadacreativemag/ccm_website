Have you seen it?  
My gown of blankets  
never leaving this house, its  
decadent shelves sick with  
stories of shipwrecks of gardens  
dressed in tulips, green scaled  
creatures with smoked eyes  
the lemon cake risen to Coltrane  
to the snow at noonâ€™s knees  
mortal rays of living of only  
getting to be so alone never  
more feasible more fanciful  
more bugless or without leaves  
preparing inquisitions to fogged  
windows to the boxed set  
DVDs, a day made mittened,  
faces lion maned and popsicled  
a neighborhood swept in salt,  
looking out to all glint and glitter
