*after mai der vang*

it begins as an anagram.  
an analogy, an impasse,  
straight split, splintering, smoking  
a thin tendril of tar-hued  
intoxicant. it begins as  
intermediary. it 
begins when they turn  
your skin inside out and  
sharpen your canines  
with cardboard. when  
they dance question  
marks down your uncut  
throat. when they answer  
for your anything  
with an apology, an anyway,  
an awareness, a progress  
and a promise of prosperity.  
when they grind your molars  
into children. eyes into vases  
the color of cobalt. when they  
put sea dragons  
into your hands. say look  
at all these lovely flowers.  
say look at all these clouds  
we're making. say nothing to  
fear to fear to fear but fear  
itself. say the weight of your  
life is no greater than the  
weight of your life. unequal and  
nightward. you say nothing  
and they'll say fear and  
nothing, they'll copyright  
your veins. they'll stuff  
your lungs. they'll parade  
your bite marks  
as proof of life.
