It starts with a tapping like mouse feet on tin  
Like he's up there futzing around  
Little nails like a pin prick within my inner ear  
Making the verga swallow me whole


Making the vertigo intensify into a downpour  
Close my eyes and feel the mist  
Coming out of the western wind  
Making me see a version stuck on old Granite


Stuck in the brush like a calf  
Tangled in laso-like vines  
Cutting into its small legs  
Dragging it down into the earth


Damp dirt the only thing to keep it from sinking  
And how wonderfulâ€“ that smell  
Of earth, making me ignore  
The lightning struck tumbleweed


Making me see grass greener than reality  
Straw colored stalks turning a wondrous green  
And the big live oak  
With the horse buried beneath  


Tender spirit twirling its way through bronchial trees  
With the love of his last breath  
Trusting his partner to lead him to his grave  
To place hand on forehead and promise


All is well  
To cry at the thump of flesh hitting desert sand  
For a rancher to render the impossible, implausible,

And when the rain stops and  
The tears begin their ascent  
The warm ground will make its way through worn boots
