With the aftertaste of summer lingering in the air, we welcome you to *Feverglow*, our ninth issue. 

For this issue, we returned to our roots and threw the doors wide open for submissions of all kinds. There was no themed call, only an invitation for your best ideas. The response was enthusiastic, and submissions swarmed our inbox like a brood of cicadas. We won’t lie. As a small team of editors, the sheer volume of submissions was daunting. But we were also excited to roll up our sleeves and get to work!
  
We reviewed hundreds of creative works and selected ten visual and nine written pieces. When considering themes, an interesting throughline emerged--warmth. This collection is hot to the touch. The stinging heat of summer, the bright burn of grief, the fever of passion. These pieces feel animated, almost alive. 
  
That restless, radiating heat gave this issue its name: *Feverglow*. Each piece within it shines on its own, but together, they burn much brighter. We hope that glow follows you even after you’ve left these pages.
  
To stoke our own fire, we have recently opened up donations to support CCM’s future. This is the first issue where financial contributors have been added to our roster of supporters. Every contribution goes directly toward CCM and fulfilling our goals, such as paying contributors, offering staff stipends, and applying for grants. As always, we are deeply grateful for your support. 

Without further ado, we invite you into this splendid collection. Stick around for the next one--and stay creative!
