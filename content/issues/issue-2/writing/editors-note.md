Hello again!

We’re happy to announce that, for the second time, Cicada Creative Magazine has published an all-arts, all-welcome, all-heart issue. Finally, something good has come from winter. Issue 02’s contributors have offered their own time, energy, and essence to our cause. Again, we’ve found ourselves humbled and in awe of the creative heart that beats in our community. All of this work has come together in original and curious ways to create a new life force behind the body of this magazine. This semester, everything has come together into one final form with a bang. That culmination reverberates throughout this whole issue. That idea of pinnacles, peaks, and climaxes has resulted in our theme for Issue 02: Moment of Impact.

In our lives, minutes and hours collect gradually - building our lives, for the most part, in slow burns. Most of our time belongs to the spaces between moments of magnitude, but when we create, this pacing does not apply. We are free to build isolated moments that punch, that pressurize, that make us feel - endlessly. In Issue 02, we’ve curated a collection of these moments, all characterized by the life cycle of a Moment of Impact - intensity, irreversibility, release, clarity. There is a humanness in experiencing the brute force of cataclysmic change. We feel the weight of the step we can’t take back. This semester, Cicada Creative Magazine has framed forty-four pieces that demonstrate this unalterable trice.

As always, we here at CCM are indebted to the contributors who have chosen this magazine as their platform. In amplifying each other’s voices, we amplify each other’s experiences. We want to honor the inexhaustible variety of lives, happenings, and moments that fuel our creative work. Issue 02 is the next step for us in our journey to create a space for all kinds of creation. As we go, we’re learning not only how best to support our community, but also how to settle in to our own form as a magazine.

Thanks for coming out for round two. We’ll see you next semester for Issue 03.
