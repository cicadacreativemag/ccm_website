You laid in bed, avoiding sleep;  
You fed, like wasted quarters  
Into a polychrome slot machine  
Four irretrievable hours;  
They paled in front of the screen.  
And, after the stardust’s hourglass  
Was wrung, and dawn was threatened,  
Your dollar hinted at a loss  
That staggered into thousands;  
Shuttered, behind the barricades  
Of comforter and slanted shades,  
You shuddered at the thought—and swept  
Your soul to sleep with sleeping aids.
