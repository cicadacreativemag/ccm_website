Joltingly, you wake, and there is penumbra  
Intrinsic gray has settled softly behind drawn curtains  
A caliginous dusk to wrap securely around you  
Chase away the furtive evils that lurk behind closed eyelids  
Bad dreams and wraiths crouch low at the edges of dimmed vision

Gossamer is gathered up in corners  
An abandoned dominion, a canopy  
Deeply breathing in a fragrant chilled air  
The window is still open  
And this dwellingâ€™s deep-set hum is covered by lilting cricket chirrup

A soothing aria so hushed and muffled  
Against your insistent, heavy pulse  
Hellebore blooms like ebony along the dark light  
Much gentler than the familiar bleeding stain you see in trepid dreams  
A murmuring of light and sound and shapes in tender conjured sight  
When eyes become too heavy, a sweeter image manifests
