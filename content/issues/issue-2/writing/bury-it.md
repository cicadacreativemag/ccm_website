Bury; the memory in the yellow dress of rum of pie of chocolate milk  
yellow dress covered in flowers that didn’t bloom  
you didn’t care for it anyway  
Bury; the girl who held your hair  
ready to drag you across the coals  
you felt like syrup then  
slow  
sticky  
& too sweet  
did she mean to peal you apart?  
Bury; the man who called feminism an opinion  
fill his coffin with the coffee cups his roommate took  
and cover them with dirt  
does it hurt to breathe in the earth like that? mixed with rocks and decay  
Bury; the way you pick at the flesh of your lips pealing the dead skin back until you taste the metallic salt of blood  
maybe you like the way it tastes  
Bury it  
Bury it  
Bury it all  
Bury; your mother alive  
watch her thrash and scream  
but bury her anyway  
so, she can’t hurt you anymore  
does it hurt?  
Bury; the girl who drank you dry  
like you drank the green apple vodka  
In the basement  
when I was 16 my mother handed me a plastic bottle  
Bury; the smell after you’ve flossed your teeth pick the dead things out,
you’ve killed them  
Bury; the time you got so drunk  
you forgot your underwear in your hurry to get the hell out of that dorm room  
you didn’t care for them anyway  
Bury; the bird that sang too loud for your unworthy ears  
Bury it in the backyard next to all your dead fish  
Bury; the Italian man who wouldn’t stop  
who left you sobbing in a shower so hot it burnt your lungs  
calling out for the boy who made you feel loved then lost you  
Bury; the things you’ve never talked about under the dirt,  
the pressure their prison,  
bury them in the grave you dig  
and cover them in red flowers  
that couldn’t bloom
