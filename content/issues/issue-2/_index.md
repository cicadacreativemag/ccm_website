# Issue 02: Moment of Impact

In our lives, minutes and hours collect gradually - building our lives, for the most part, in slow burns. Most of our time belongs to the spaces between moments of magnitude, but when we create, this pacing does not apply. We are free to build isolated moments that punch, that pressurize, that make us feel - endlessly. In Issue 02, we’ve curated a collection of these moments, all characterized by the life cycle of a Moment of Impact - intensity, irreversibility, release, clarity. There is a humanness in experiencing the brute force of cataclysmic change. We feel the weight of the step we can’t take back. This semester, Cicada Creative Magazine has framed forty-two pieces that demonstrate this unalterable trice.
