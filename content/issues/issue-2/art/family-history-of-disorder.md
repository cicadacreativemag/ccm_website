{{< lightbox-img lightbox-id="fam" img-src="/images/issue2/19_disorder.jpg" alt="A woman with angel wings, a single tear, and red hair reaching out to a grim-reaper animalistic figure holding two young girls in pink dresses. The angel is bound by her wrist with a rope that extends off the canvas. A car is sinking into the ground. A plume of black smoke frames the composition. There is a road in the back with car tracks veering off, implying a car crash." >}}
