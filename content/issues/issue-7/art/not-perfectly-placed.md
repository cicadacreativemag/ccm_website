*I began this collage around one year ago. At the time I had just broken my right clavicle. My writing side. It was a 'Z' shaped break. During the healing process, I decided to keep a digital diary, it was the most accessible option for creating with lack of mobility. A place to house markings, words, shapes, blueprints and inspiration. These simple mind maps helped me to navigate the emotional complexities of healing. They allowed me to look forward to when I'd be fully able to make all of my pent-up ideas come to fruition. Throughout the year I slowly added to this collage and began creating others. This practice of expression organically became a new and cemented part of my creative routine, the plans themselves becoming valued work.*
