{{< lightbox-img lightbox-id="ontheshore" img-src="/images/issue7/brink.webp" alt="A man wearing a tan suit is laying down in a pool of green, yellow, pink, and purple water. His eyes are closed and his cheek is pressed to the water, his arms sprawled out in front of him and fingers partly submerged by the liquid. The scene is surreal in its palette and the background is dark and stormy." >}}
