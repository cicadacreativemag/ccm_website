*Michael Stonecipher from the developing IP No One Lives Forever  on the shores of the island of Maui. Michael Stoncipher is a character who has been stripped away of his indigenous identity and heritage by the United States government. Part of his growth as a character in No One Lives Forever is coming to terms with the lack of connection to his bloodline, native lands, and heritage that has been artificially cut from him.*

His eyes are closed and his cheek is pressed to the water, his arms sprawled out in front of him and fingers partly submerged by the liquid. The scene is surreal in its palette and the background is dark and stormy." >}}
