*This piece represents finding a precious place for the artist. As they are currently going down the journey of life, the artist asks herself what "X" is.*

{{< lightbox-img lightbox-id="x" img-src="/images/issue7/xmarksthespot.webp" alt="Three people are silhoutted in red and stare into the distance. In the sky, a giant white X made of dots is surrounded by a spiked orange-red halo. There is a cutout of a tree reflecting orange light to the right and a dead tree to the left. THe entire image is seemingly framed by a cardboard background." >}}
