{{< lightbox-img link="/images/issue7/Untitled.webp" lightbox-id="untitled" img-src="/images/issue7/Untitled.webp#issues" alt="A pencil drawing of a neighborhood is interrupted by a black tear in the image, and several figures are walking through it. The front-most figure is a yellow character holding a can, and behind them, there are humanoid creatures, some without faces, one playing the trumpet, and one pointing down the street. They are all colorful." >}}
