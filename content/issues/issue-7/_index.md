# Issue 07: 'You are here'

Maps are, at their most essential, symbolic diagrams that outline relationships between things. Most commonly, they are visualizations of geographical data, but anything can be mapped: a brain, a body, a home, a memory. This issue, we invited you to contemplate where you stand on your own maps--to take a moment to orient yourself and consider where youâ€™ve been and where you want to go.
