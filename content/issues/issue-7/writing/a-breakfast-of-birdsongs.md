My sole worshipped the  
dew-wet red earth of Oraifite  
—into the fog, one hesitant step  
after another, blind thoughts  
stumbled into each other.

I courted morning—  
eulogized the nude  
sun in her shrine of sky.  
Prayed the rays to be soft,  
lush like a squirrel's tail.

Here, god is an animal!  
You don't use sticks  
or rocks on a python's head,  
else you let misfortune into  
your home.

I was more at home  
on croaking paths—  
in a church of chirps  
& whispering fronds.  
For the markets are wild  
& lonely for the foreigner.  
They say the people are simple  
& friendly. But here I was pelted  
with stones of eyes each time  
I walked down the streets—  
scorned with silence. 

I'd rather learn to speak  
in avian tongues  
so I could daily join  
the little bird  
on my window pane  
in its morning praise—  
learn the dialect of rodents  
& chit-chat mango-loving   
squirrels on my way to site...
