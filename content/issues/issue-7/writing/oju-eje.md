& this city is pretty at dawn  
—the waters snore beneath  
a soft blanket of shimmer.  
Eko bridge comes awake as  
vehicular roosters announce

serenity blurs, disperses into  
daylight. Wheels of industry  
grind loud at the Marina—  
tides of hustlers, hoodlums  
& uniformed miscreants leave  
the eyes of the street red & dirty...
