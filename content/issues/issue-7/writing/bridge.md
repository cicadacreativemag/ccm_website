Wound up in air-conditioned car,  
GPs locked in a loop of route, you  
don't see the sore in the earth by  
the fruit sellers, the clogged gutter  
beneath the amala place. You don't  
remember how this city smells—  
like a wound, festering perpetually.  
Like fermented sweat in a crowded  
bus or a grave of premature dreams.  
A day as a commuter & I witnessed  
a different city—the stench of rust  
& distrust, burning weed & despair.  
The new pedestrian bridge at Durbar  
junction is shelter to roamers, altar  
for ailing beggars waiting for dawn  
& a miracle of alms. The city below  
feels so vulnerable. Dawn is uneasy  
omen & the sun ominously weighs  
down on sky's neck. The air is heavy,  
rife with frustration & benign hope  
Danfo driver slaps a sachet of eru jeje,  
tears off the tip & drowns his liver in  
3cl of hot dry river—I shift onto my  
left buttock, the other passengers  
do not bat an eyelid. I say a prayer &  
strangle a bus evangelist who started  
a revival, stuff the voice of the drug  
salesman in the cords of my earpiece.  
Rain just stopped & petrichor smells  
like a curse. But somehow, I survive  
a Lagos morning without my car.
