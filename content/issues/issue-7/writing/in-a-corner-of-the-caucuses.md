Today the Caspian Sea pulses with oil and sun.  
Everyone is a storyteller, everyone consumes  
pomegranate poetry. Outside, I keep queerness  
an absurd secret. In the porcelain mountains  
men sell jars and colors. The shepherd sits like a child,  
his toy sheep scattered in the green. 

I meet three Zoroastrians at a rave.  
They tell me how, before the land  
borders closed, they’d drive to Tbilisi   
every weekend just for the party, not in Escape  
but in Pursuit, and how I could have gone  
with them had we met years ago. 

We agree that August is for growing pains,  
for limbs longing to breathe,  
for the Caspian to swell,  
for vowels to strain under burdens of speech. 

Today I am everyone’s granddaughter and ex-best friend.  
An old man kisses another and I find rose juice  
in the grocery store. I don’t know which god  
to thank for it all. 

On Sunday a helicopter struck two birds  
and they plunged, humble and easy, like human rain. 

I cried at the Collapse.
