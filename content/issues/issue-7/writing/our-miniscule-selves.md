Electronic feelers precede  
our shifting train car, my brain  
in its shell grooved, lunar.  
The Rockies smooth

open our skin, its tiny eruptions  
a shower of unguarded stars.   
Colorado—

its eagle prayers  
a cyclone of growing. Gravity  
cats’ claws scratch from cliff edge  
to temple stone. Shakespeare’s  
dream a strident moon unspooling  
its lightning-threaded hail.  

Pearl Street ribbons spun  
through empty hands, drenched  
in Ariel’s waves. You needn’t wonder

why perfect girls drive weather  
outside their sorrows,  
untie the tempest  
from its altitude of memory. 

Open yourself. Persistent mountains  
teach peace. Opalescent boulders  
speak colors into lofty.  
Absent whales flood enormity  
with hot-blooded intention, fluke 

mantra, ascend the harpoon—  
My silent roll backward, my Lake  
of Summer, my Sea of Peaks.  
Float larger with me. Unloose

your swarm of gods! Feed the sky  
with the insane laughter of haystacks   
aflame, your hungry organs purr.
