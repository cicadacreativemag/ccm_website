Silver bubble sibyll  
bellies up, willow-lashed  
floating to a brackish place  
we like to call our home.  
there, the elliptical lake  
there, the march of spectral signs  
bodies fattened. salt and blood  
all of us, alone.

\*

we were here.  
we go back years.  
(pleistocene,  
fare thee well)

we gorged on dragonflies-  
now: open wound. opened.

concrete canker, jewel fin  
hungry for a strip of sky  
snatching at the city mice.  
we wonder.

\*

we were here.  
before you came,  
iron-dry, pale-cheeked  
mud crack land gods  
spitting slurry laws  
what is and is not,  
a love for sanding things,  
our hair snared in your net  
our blood against your jaws.  
we remember.

\*

we are not hunter's bait  
we are not half and half  
you think in smoke and gangrene  
we think in river song  
we were here: in tidal pools,  
we'll be here when cities fall,  
iridescent, onyx-eyed  
thousand banded, thousand strong.  
we will stay.

\*

we see them sift  
bony knees on shallow flats  
cupping metacarpals,  
wondering at each ritual ring

we watch them dust  
time from teeth and skull,  
victor's loss. what pity,  
to have never heard us sing.  
we are not dead.
