land of a thousand hills,  
called with the fondness of natives -  
Hutu, Tutsi and Twa  
and the elevated. 
I remember you; 

true blue skies  
lands greening and ing  
air, fresh as the morning  
and your hair, a natural sheen  
in the sun - high and nigh 
  
the modesty of your women  
the comeliness of your men  
and the innocence of your children.  
this savoury taste lingers of mizuzu  
and passion fruit.

elevated above the tremor of a genocidal past  
as a leader in the assembly of nations.  
your name I proclaim, Rwanda  
your fame, landlocked in the rift valley of the centre   
I give you the sobriquet, “The Great”
