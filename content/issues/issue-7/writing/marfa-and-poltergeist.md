we take the long way  
to marfa  
desert highway  
six under the limit  
stop for amaretto ice cream  
one scoop  
melts fast in the lost horse saloon  
parking lot  
buy used leather  
boots with cash  
at lunch she meets  
a jowly man in the restroom  
they plant a bald cypress out back  
she returns in an armadillo coat  
the black dress purchased  
at daveâ€™s thrift last wednesday   
beneath  
at sunset the cypress is a forest  
she lays three bluebonnets  
at the edge  
we drive back  
headlights off  
*I buried a man* she says  
I know  
I was there
