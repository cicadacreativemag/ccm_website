{{< lightbox-img lightbox-id="siren" img-src="/images/issue8/sirens_call.jpg" alt="The foreground figures are in monochrome with the exception of hot pink accents. The central figure is a woman with bright lipstick dripping form her lips. She is puckering her lips next to a phone, which has a kiss mark on the top and is dripping more liquid from the end. The background shows hearts echoing." >}}
