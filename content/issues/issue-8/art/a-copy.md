*This piece, inclusive of its title, embraces a foundation of self-irony. The nature of digital collaging, with its capacity for repeated use of elements and the influence of personal preferences, sets the stage for a potential trap of repetition. This is accentuated by the deployment of the same model in varying, and sometimes conflicting, poses and gestures, alongside the recurring presence of the familiar mask.*
