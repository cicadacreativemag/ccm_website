marshal got stuck in a locker  
the result was erosion  
light pink T-shirt and gold coach shoes  
I read on my porch  
sad but not depressed  
there is hardly a place  
that cannot support such  
barren physical movement  
how can we who are not  
ascend the mountain not like the mountain bird

The Pa Mong project in Vietnam uprooted 450,000 people  
I went with Nad to get popcorn  
Have no fear  
they just don’t turn me on.  
Yea right, if we have to drive our people to paradise  
an inevitable consequence  
bc i can get very hyper.

I know I shouldn’t be offended but?  
generally covered with scrub  
and looking badly  
we pretended to not know where anyone was  
for like 5 minutes  
Jerd hid under the desk all period  
while others are burned

I did not get my seat back  
but I will  
have no fear  
mere sentimentalism  
I shall RULE!!!  
with sticks  
to paradise

I am, I am well I’m not sure what I am  
an intimate constant weeding  
it was to be a simple case  
as userish as ever  
very tan, very fab  
her Hanes tee rolled up at the cuffs
