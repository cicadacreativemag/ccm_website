{{< contributors name="Elzbieta Zdunek" link="https://www.instagram.com/surrellart/" linktitle="@surrellart" statement="Whenever I am asked to describe my work, I respond with the quote by historian and novelist Umberto Eco: 'every story tells a story that has already been told.' In my collages and photography, by reusing recurring topics and elements, I highlight the inevitability of events and their consequences; the repeating cycles and patterns in the history of humanity; the meshed hope and hopelessness; and how often what we think we have an agency to choose has been chosen for us beforehand. Knowing that viewers will approach and read my works through their own biases and experiences, I encourage them to decide who is the hero and who is the villain, or if the outcome is a blessing or a curse. I am fascinated with the concepts of nature versus nurture, what makes us us, and how many different people we are depending on the context." piece1link="/issue-8/a-copy-a-copy-a/" piece1="a copy a copy a" piece1description="Digital Collage.
