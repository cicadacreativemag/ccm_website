In 1993, id Software found a way to run DOOM on a human brain.

The Moirai (referred to in English as the Fates) are the first known runners of DOOM.

The Pronghorn Antelope lives in North America but was preyed on cheetahs pre-continental drift. Thus, it became the second fastest land animal in the world, with no predator on its continent anywhere near fast enough to threaten it. The pronghorn can reach speeds of 61 miles per hour (88.5 km/h,) about twice the speed of DOOM.

An example of nominative determinism can be found in Daniel Dumille, known professionally as MF DOOM, who ran the game.

Pheidippides, courier of Athens, flew from the battle of Marathon to his hometown upon witnessing the Persian naval fleet retreat. He shed his belongings and clothes for maximum weightlessness and proclaimed victory to the city-stateâ€™s leaders before dropping dead. This distance (25 mi or 40 km) is unsprintable, guaranteeing Pheidippides time for thought.  At any moment, he could have recognized the superfluity of his mission and paused for a drink of water. But no, he ran even through the city gates, his junk whipping and windburnt, his feet pounding higher against the cobblestone stairs of his beloved city, and he was so full of joy he could not even look at it one last time before finding the foot of a magistrate and dying to wheeze "we win." This is one of the most famous historical examples of running DOOM.
