The Moirai (referred to in English as the Fates) are the first known runners of DOOM.

In 1993 a programmer found a way to run DOOM on a human brain. 

The Pronghorn Antelope lives in North America but was preyed on cheetahs before continental drift. Thus, it became the second fastest land animal in the world, and no predator on its continent is anywhere near fast enough to threaten it. The running antelope can reach speeds of up to 61 miles per hour (88.5 km/h,) which is about twice the speed of DOOM. 

A perfect example of nominative determinism can be found in Daniel Dumille, known professionally as MF DOOM, who ran the game.

Pheidippides, soldier of Athens, upon observing the retreat of the Persian naval fleet, flew from the battle of Marathon to his hometown, shedding his belongings and clothes for maximum weightlessness, arrived in the midst of the state's leaders, and proclaimed their victory before falling down dead. This distance is not one that can be sprinted, leaving time for idle thought. Pheidippides could have, at any moment, recognized the superfluity of his mission and paused. He ran even through the city gates, his junk whipping and windburnt, his feet pounding higher against cobblestone stairs, through the city he loved and would never see again, so full of joy that he could not even look at it, found the foot of a magistrate, and died to say "we won." This is one of the most famous historical examples of running DOOM. 

An animal is considered intelligent when DOOM can be run on it.
