Itâ€™s so simple, her blonde hair says,  
Twirled up in a little pouf and secured with gold claws.  
One bowl, easy methods, and  
It uses ingredients you have in your pantry already!  
Flour, butter, and sugar, the lacey printout reads,  
But in my pantry are  
Rice, cooking oil, and rock candy.   
Chocolate chips, she smiles indulgently,  
Sesame clusters, I answer silently.  
A strand of black falls in my eyes.  
I brush it away.  
Grab some money  
and the keys  
and reach for the door.
