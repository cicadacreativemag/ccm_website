    I’m a Puerto Rican & Cuban American who focuses on Mixed Media Interdisciplinary works. I was raised in both Union City, NJ & Miami, FL but am currently living and working in Denver, CO. My work combines my life experiences with digital watercolor, graphic art, sculpture, and photo editing techniques; showcasing a modern style with dark & twisty influences from society, politics, and music.<br><br>

    Through the art that I create I express the struggles I feel myself and those that I believe are universal and that everyone can relate to.  I express the defamiliarization and estrangement of the body and soul that explodes into a metaphysical space.<br><br>

    I completed my Bachelor's degree at Colorado State University in the midst of a global pandemic. I usually write genre fiction, but sometimes things happen that are too perplexing not to write poetry about. My poetry is inspired by modern spoken word poets who not only seek to break the rules, but also make it poetry accessible to non-poets.<br><br>
    <a href="/issue-3/alone/"><em>alone </em></a><br>
    "alone" was written after, in a freak accident, my glass shower door shattered. I wanted to capture the bizarre nature of the experience in the form of the poem, but still create something understandable to those who don't commonly read poetry (hence the backslashes in place of punctuation and spaces). The use of jarring sentences was also meant to mimic the shattered nature of the glass and capture my thoughts and feelings during the experience.<br>

    Art Education</em><br><br>
    As an art education major, I love exploring as many mediums as possible to expand my horizon of experience and knowledge. Knowing as much as I can about different content areas will allow me to provide greater opportunities and a multiplicity of creative outlets for my future students. I also explore mental health topics in many of my individual works and collections as a mode of spreading awareness, promoting change, and employing art making as a form of emotional healing.<br><br>

    As an international student at CSU from the Netherlands, I used all the opportunities and resources I had during this year abroad to gather more experience. I took various classes from engineering to graphic design. Design is something I have been interested in since I was younger. I have been drawing and sketching all my life and the classes at CSU expanded my knowledge and skills even more, which I like to apply in various personal projects and projects for school. This study gives me the opportunity to explore the field of design and engineering together, two of my biggest passions.<br><br>
  <a href="/issue-3/bold-reminders/"><em>Bold Reminders</em></a><br>
    Bold Reminders is a collection of laser cut, hand-assembled, acrylic statement jewelry. Each piece encompasses a specific word(s) relating to proper mental health practices for individuals who experience mental health challenges, their potential support systems, and the wider public. The placement of each piece corresponds with the action(s) being promoted. We created this collection in order to popularize self-care, empathy, and the benefits of basic societal kindness.<br>

    I work most with ink and acrylic paint and lately I'm inspired most by degraded film. I try to replicate the aspects of film degrade and the other weird things that happen to old stills. I also gravitate towards high contrast lighting and enjoy focusing on only the shadows in some scenes, keeping silhouettes minimal but detailed.<br><br>

    I am a student eager to learn as much as I can about this world and how we create lasting connections as an ever-changing society. Through academic pursuits, I have studied cultures, religions, languages, art, and architecture in effort to understand my identity as well as the identities of people who have come before me. While my focus in art history is the medieval world, I find myself creating, living, and learning in our current conditions, responding in poetry, sculpture, and critical thought. Now, I am compelled to use my abilities as a bilingual student to spark connections across worlds that seem different.<br><br>

    Hi I'm Jae! I'm a non-binary lesbian, they/them pronouns, and I have been writing poetry for many years but only recently gained enough confidence to share them with others. I write mostly poetry and short stories as well as pieces that push the boundaries of genre.<br><br>

    English & Literary Arts, Creative Writing</em><br><br>
    Writing has always been a catharsis, and a flush of all my thoughts, and having lived in Colorado my whole life I feel that my practice has become interwoven to the earth and nature too. I'm a big traveler and I've been able to connect with many places, but nothing quite the same has come from anywhere else than Colorado, and specifically my home of Denver during this year, where my best work has certainly come from. I've been in search of great avenues for these pieces I love, so I'm excited to finally get my work out to be read through creative magazines like this one.<br><br>

    Writing has always been what I hold most dear and personal. I feel that literature is first and foremost a look into how the world affects a singular human being, and I strive to cradle and nourish those individualistic experiences when I write more than anything else.<br><br>

    Environmental Engineering</em><br><br>
    Although I'm studying engineering, creativity and visual arts are central in my life. I hope to work directly to solve environmental issues through engineering and indirectly by inspiring others through visual art. However, I by no means limit myself to just environmentalist themes. I primarily work with watercolor, colored pencil, graphite, and clay.<br><br>
