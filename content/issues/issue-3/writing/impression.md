I wanted you to see the black slipper  
Silk vest cat eyed  
Skin-tight woman.  
Wanted you to see the soft  
Silhouette I leave  
Crumpled sheets  
And how late I come home.

What time of day  
Did you realize I was a lie?  
The blue-washed turtleneck  
High waisted sweatpants  
Of a soil soul.  
Succulent, herb garden girl  
Parched of sunlight.

Was it that first Saturday night  
At a sticky 11:04 pm when—  
Knowing all along how  
My laugh sounded  
And feet tripped—  
You knew I’d eat up  
Your compliments?
