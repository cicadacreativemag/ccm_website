reclaiming the garden  
where my mother walked  
within me grown barren

muscles strain to be free  
screams of anger quieted  
the storm-rage barred beauty

standing on the edge of  
past painted over silent  
and future freeing love

replant the uprooted  
give voice to past voiceless  
give form to the muted

reclaiming my lilith  
from inner fury to  
singing my sins my truth
