A Visage Overlaid  
Like A Dream, Or Illusion  
In Mirrorâ€™s Constant Glaze

Wide Hues Form His Shapes  
Curves Sleek Form Her Shapes  
Comfortable He/She Shapes

But His/Her Foreign Patterns  
Not Reflected In my own  
Uncomfortable Fluid Figure

Enough Alike A Woman  
To Slip To Unknown Unequal  
In Every Day Assumption

Disjunction Is Disfigurement  
In Their Eyes As i Have Not  
The Calf They Idolize

Inequality Is Just  
In Their Eyes As i Have Not  
The Phallus They Idolize
