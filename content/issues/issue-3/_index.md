Summary:  In the midst of a pandemic and racial movement, we asked, who are you? Who are we?

We first selected identity as our theme for Issue 03 back in January of 2020. As a magazine originally based at Colorado State University, we noticed a <a href="https://collegian.com/2019/09/category-news-swastika-drawing-found-on-wall-in-aggie-village/">marked</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/white-colorado-state-students-won-t-be-punished-over-blackface-n1053126">uptick</a> in racist acts on campus. Soon after a student movement grew and responded, CSU went remote, along with most universities across the country. Racial equity demonstrations across the country followed not long after. If anything, the Black Lives Matter movement and the COVID-19 pandemic have made it more important than ever to conduct dialogue about who we are, how we feel, and what the world looks like for us now. <br><br>

Today, we debut Issue 03 of Cicada Creative Magazine, with brand-new pieces from fifteen undergraduate creatives. We asked our community: who are you? Who are we? In Issue 03, you’ll find 20 hand-picked pieces that each think through identity in their own creative ways. They show us how the self is constructed by its experiences, actions, and transformations—much like the identities in flux as a result of our global pandemic and the racial movements of this year.
