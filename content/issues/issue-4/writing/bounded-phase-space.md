1.

Let me preach to you a second  
Priestly, for you must believe  
Without understanding why.

In bounded phase space,  
Where fluids turn flat and ideal  
Temperatures are negative.

I mean truly negative,  
Kelvin negative, less than  
Absolute zero negative.

In most systems adding energy  
Means an increase in entropy  
Not for us though. Not for us.

[SOME SYSTEMS ONLY HOLD AS MUCH ENERGY AS SWEET TEA HOLDS SUGAR]

A pile of white packets on the table; I am asking for a little more sweetness, a little more sugar, sugar.  
A little more, a little more, until it breaks, until

[SUPER SATURATION, THE CRYSTALS FALLING LIKE HAIL, OH HAIL MARY FULL OF SUGAR, FULL OF GRACE, THE TEA IS READY DARLING]

Honey, sweetie, darling, the tea is ready. Your tea is ready, darling.

Do you see now? Do you see?  
You don’t, I got lost and you  
Got lost. I’m sorry, darling.

Redefine temperature as  
Statistical entropy, that is  
Forget thermodynamics.

I don’t have much time,  
Add energy, add energy  
Until it cannot hold any more

I’m on my last stanza,  
There are only so many states  
Order them, order them, order them.

[AND THUS THE LORD SAID, IN CHAOS THERE SHALL BE ORDER, IN DARKNESS THERE SHALL BE NUCLEAR FUSION. THERE, RADIANT RADIATION SHALL BE LIGHT.]

Please, I want to tell them, I want to tell them, I don’t understand yet but I want to tell them.

[CERTAIN BOUND PARTICLE SYSTEMS HAVE A MAXIMUM ENERGY THEY CAN HOLD. UPON APPROACHING THIS MAXIMUM THE SYSTEM WILL DECREASE IN ENTROPY.]

And thus the Lord said, Let the points cluster.  
And thus He said, According to the model of statistical entropy, a system tending towards order in high energy states indicates a negative temperature.

5.

Five is mine, now I can  
Tell you, tell you, tell you.  
The Law of Moses states,

Heat always flows from  
Hot to cold, hot to cold  
Your tea is getting cold.

And a supersaturated system  
Is very hot, so be careful with  
That cup, my darling.

Heat flows from negative  
Systems to positive systems  
And still runs hot to cold.

6.

[IMAGINE THE SHATTERED CUP FALLING ONTO THE TABLE INTO SHAPE, THE ORDERING OF HIGH ENERGY STATES, A FIXING WHERE THERE SHOULD BE BREAKING, TIME RUNNING BACKWARDS]

Directional time obeys entropy, as it moves forward entropy increases always.  
If entropy decreases, the cup shatters into place. The tape rewinds. And if entropy is how we distinguish past from future,
