                    <p>Cicada was founded in 2018, the brainchild of seven undergraduate students at Colorado State University. We wanted to assemble something new: a creative magazine accessible to all CSU undergraduate students across all disciplines. At the time, our on-campus publications were open only to a sliver of students based on GPA or major, and most literary magazines focus exclusively on writing and/or visual art. We believe these limitations stifle creativity and expression. There is artistry in science, in math, in lines of code â€” and we wanted to include it all.</p>

                    
                    <p>We&#39;ve evolved a lot since our first meetings at a coffee shop on the corner of campus, but our core mission has never wavered. Instead, it has expanded. When the COVID-19 pandemic moved the world online in 2020, we adapted and went fully remote, opening our submissions to undergraduates everywhere. </p>
                    <p>And as of Issue 07, <em>anyone</em> can submit to CCM and apply for staff.</p>
                    <p>Submissions open twice a year, typically in the spring and fall. At the end of each issue cycle, these submissions are anonymized and reviewed by two editorial teams. Then, we publish a carefully crafted issue of your work.</p>
                    <p>We acknowledge that art doesn&#39;t always come box-shaped, perfectly ready to fall into a category. Cicada Creative Magazine exists to showcase that artistic exploration and novelty.</p>
                    <p>We hope to broadcast each and every way you make your mark on our world.</p>
